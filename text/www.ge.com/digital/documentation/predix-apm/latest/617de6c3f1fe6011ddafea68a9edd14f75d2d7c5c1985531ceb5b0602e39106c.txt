Event TimelineAbout the Event TimelineIn Root Cause Analysis, a Failure Event is often the result of a sequence of contributing events. The Event Timeline is an organizational tool that enables RCA Team Members to collate and display Event data in a form that provides a visual representation of the timeline in which a sequence of contributing events have played out. Once you have added a primary Event to the Event Timeline, you can add Secondary Events to create a more detailed representation of events associated with the failure.Access the Event Timeline ProcedureAccess the Root Cause Analysis for which you want to view the Event Timeline.In the pane, select the Event Timeline tab.The Event Timeline for the selected RCA appears in the workspace.
