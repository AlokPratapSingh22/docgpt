Individual ReportsAnalysis Summary Report
The Analysis Summary Report displays summary information that is stored in the RCA Analysis record. The report is divided into the following sections:

Analysis Data
: Contains general information about the analysis. 
Location Data
: Contains information about the location of the piece of equipment being analyzed.
Equipment Data
: Contains information about the piece of equipment that is being analyzed.



The name of the analysis, which is stored in the Analysis Name field in the RCA Analysis record, is displayed at the top of the Analysis Summary Report. The following table lists each item in the report and the corresponding RCA Analysis record field whose data is displayed in the report.
Note: The Location Data and Equipment Data
: sections exist in the Analysis Summary Report so that you can view this information in analyses where it existed in previous releases. In the product, the Definition tab on the Analysis Summary workspace allows you to link Equipment and Functional Location records to the RCA Analysis record. Asset information is no longer stored in fields in the RCA Analysis record, which are used to populate values in the Analysis Summary Report. You can view information in Equipment and Functional Location records that are linked to the RCA Analysis record using the 
Assets
 subsection of the PROACT RCA Analysis-At-A-Glance Overview section in the Comprehensive Analysis report.

Cause Report
The Cause Report displays information that is stored in RCA Hypothesis records that are linked to the RCA Analysis record and contain a value of Cause - Physical, Cause - Latent, or Cause - Human in the State field. This information is displayed in two different formats:
The Type of Causes graph.A table below the graph.
The following image displays the Types of Causes graph. The x-axis displays the types of cause (i.e., human, physical, and latent). The y-axis displays the number of RCA Hypothesis records that contain a cause in the State field, which is also viewed in the Logic Tree section. 



The table below the graph displays information related to each RCA Hypothesis record that is linked to the RCA Analysis record.



The following table lists each item in the Cause Report and the corresponding RCA Hypothesis record field whose data is displayed in the report. A row exists for each RCA Hypothesis record and is categorized by the cause state (i.e., physical, latent, or human), which is stored in the State field of the RCA Hypothesis record.

Logic Tree Summary Report
The Logic Tree Summary Report consists of two parts:
The Logic Tree Summary By Node Type graph.A table that displays the information in the graph.
The following image displays the Logic Tree Summary By Node Type graph. The x-axis displays the hypothesis state of the node, which is stored in the State field of each corresponding RCA Hypothesis record. The y-axis displays the number of nodes that exist in the Logic Tree for each type of state.



The table below the graph contains the same information in a chart form. In this case, the values in the Node State column are equivalent to the Hypothesis State values in the graph, and the values in the Node Count column are equivalent to the Total Number on Logic Tree values in the graph. The value in the Total row is the total number of nodes that exist in the Logic Tree with a value in the State field in the corresponding RCA Hypothesis record.



Verification Report
The Verification Report displays information that is stored in each RCA Verification record and the RCA Hypothesis record that is linked to an RCA Verification record. It also displays information stored in the Human Resource record that is linked to the RCA Team Member record, which is linked to the RCA Verification record. The report includes each RCA Verification record that is linked to the RCA Analysis record.



The name of the analysis, which is stored in the Analysis Name field in the RCA Analysis record, is displayed at the top of the Verification Report. The following table lists each item in the report and the corresponding RCA Verification, RCA Hypothesis, or Human Resource record field whose data is displayed in the report.
