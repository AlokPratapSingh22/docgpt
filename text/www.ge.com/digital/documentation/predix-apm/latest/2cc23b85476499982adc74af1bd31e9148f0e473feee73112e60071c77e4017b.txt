Comprehensive Analysis ReportAbout RCA Reports
The baseline RCA module provides the following types of baseline reports:



Comprehensive
: The Comprehensive Analysis report includes information about the entire RCA. You can customize the data that appears in the report to display data associated with all stages of the RCA. The Comprehensive Analysis report is stored in the following folder in the GE Digital APM Catalog: \\Public\Meridium\Modules\RCA\SSRS.
Important: This report is built from the queries and reports stored in the SSRS folder. You should not change the name of the SSRS Catalog folder, the name or content of any item within the folder, or remove from the folder any item that is being used by the comprehensive report. Modifying or moving any of these items could cause the Comprehensive Analysis Report to stop working.

 Individual : Multiple reports that display data associated with specific areas of an RCA Analysis. The individual reports are stored in the GE Digital APM Catalog folder \\Public\Meridium\Modules\RCA. Keep in mind that the Reports List page displays all reports that are stored in the RCA folder.
Note:  All items in the Public folder are also available in the corresponding Baseline folder. Throughout this documentation, however, we refer to items in the Public folder.
