Each supporting query that is listed in this table contains a prompt on the ENTY_KEY field of the RCA family. When you run a report from the Reports List page, the ENTY_KEY of the RCA associated with the current RCA is passed automatically to the prompt. After the ENTY_KEY is passed, the results for the current RCA are displayed. If you run an RCA report or query from the Catalog, however, you will need to supply the ENTY_KEY for an RCA manually to retrieve results.
