General ReferenceSIS Management Data Model
The following diagram shows how the families used in SIS Management are related to one another.



Note: In the diagram, boxes represent entity families and arrows represent relationship families that are configured in the baseline database. You can determine the direction of each relationship definition from the direction of the arrow head: the box from which the arrow originates is the predecessor. The box to which the arrow head points is the successor.
All SIL Analyses begin with an SIL Analysis record. Each SIL Analysis can be linked to:
One Equipment or Functional Location record.One or more Human Resource records.One or more Reference Document records.One or more Instrumented Function records.One or more Logic Solver records.
Each Logic Solver is linked to:
One or more Instrumented Function records.One or more SIS Proof Test records.One or more SIS Proof Test Template records.
Each Instrumented Function is linked to:
One Equipment or Functional Location record.One or more Protective Instrument Loop records.One or more Inspection Task records.
One Risk Assessment record.One LOPA Assessment record. One Process Hazards Analysis (PHA) Assessment record.One or more External Assessment records.One or more SIS Proof Test records.One or more SIS Proof Test Template records.
To simplify the data model images, the following families are not included:

Risk Assessment Recommendation: Within the SIS Management data model, the Risk Assessment Recommendation family participates as the successor in the Has Recommendations relationship definition with the following families:Instrumented FunctionProtective Instrument LoopSIS Proof TestSIS Proof Test Template


Hazards Analysis: The Hazards Analysis family participates as the successor in the Has HAZOP Reference relationship definition with the SIL Analysis and Instrumented Function families.
SIL Analysis Data Model
The following diagram shows how the families used in an SIL Analysis are related to one another.



Note: In the diagram, boxes represent entity families and arrows represent relationship families that are configured in the baseline database. You can determine the direction of the each relationship definition from the direction of the arrow head: the box from which the arrow originates is the predecessor, and the box to which the arrow head points is the successor.
You can see that records in the following families are linked directly to an SIL Analysis:

Human Resource : Stores information about the people who will participate in the analysis as SIL analysis team members.
Reference Document : Stores the URL path to a document that is external to GE Digital APM and contains reference information related to the SIL analysis.
Instrumented Function : Stores information about the instrumented functions of the safety instrumented system that you are analyzing.
Logic Solver : Stores information about the safety instrumented systems that you are analyzing.
Additionally, Logic Solver) records and Instrumented Function) records are linked to one another through the Has IF relationship. In addition to the relationships described above, an SIL analysis includes records in the families that are linked to the Logic Solvers and Instrumented Functions.
Instrumented Function Data Model
The following diagram shows how the families used to create an Instrumented Function are related to one another.



Note: In the diagram, boxes represent entity families and arrows represent relationship families that are configured in the baseline database. You can determine the direction of each relationship definition from the direction of the arrow head: the box from which the arrow originates is the predecessor, and the box to which the arrow head points is the successor.
Instrumented Function records are linked directly to records in the following families:

Inspection Task: Stores details on when a proof test should be performed on the Equipment that is linked to the Inspection Task, including the due date for the task.
SIS Proof Test: Stores details about a test that is performed on a logic solver or an instrumented function and serves as a record of the event.
SIS Proof Test Template: Stores details about the steps that should be taken when testing an instrumented function. When you create an SIS Proof Test, you must select an SIS Proof Test Template, and the details from the SIS Proof Test Template will be populated in the SIS Proof Test.
SIS Proof Test Task: Stores details of proof test tasks that are scheduled for logic solvers or instrumented functions. SIS Proof Test Tasks can be linked to SIS Proof Tests.
Risk Assessment: Stores the unmitigated risk associated with the item represented by the record to which the Risk Assessment record is linked.
Protective Instrument Loop: Stores the details of the protective instrument loop and its components, including the calculated results of the proof test associated with the Logic Solver that is linked to the Protective Instrument Loop.
LOPA Assessment: Stores the details of the Layer of Protection Analysis (LOPA) that conducted, including a description of the initiating event that is indicative of a process failure. The LOPA stores details of the risk assessment that is determined after conducting the Layer of Protection Analysis. The LOPA Assessment is linked to a LOPA record and the LOPA records are linked to Risk Assessment record.
PHA Internal Assessment: Stores the details of the Process Hazards Analysis (PHA) assessment that you want to conduct, including the target Safety Integrity Level (SIL), Required Probability of Failure, Risk Reduction Factor, and the SIL Mode. These values are calculated based on the overall risk rank of the selected Hazards Analysis Consequence.
Risk Matrix Internal Assessment: Stores the details of the risk matrix assessment that you want to conduct, including the target Safety Integrity Level (SIL), Required Probability of Failure, Risk Reduction Factor, and the SIL Mode. These values are calculated based on the risk rank that you specify using the risk matrix.
External Assessment: Stores the details of the external assessment that you want to conduct, including the target SIL, Required Probability of Failure, Risk Reduction Factor, and the SIL Mode. 
SIF Common Cause Failure: Stores the details of a failure that affects the operation of multiple instrumented functions.
Instrumented Function: Indicates that if both the instrumented functions represented by the two records are in their safe states at the same time, a hazardous event may occur.
Logic Solver Data Model
The following diagram shows how the families used to create a Logic Solver are related to one another.



 In the diagram, the relationships between the Instrumented Function family and the SIS Proof Test, SIS Proof Test Task, and SIS Proof Test Template families are not included.
Note: In the diagram, boxes represent entity families and arrows represent relationship families that are configured in the baseline database. You can determine the direction of the each relationship definition from the direction of the arrow head: the box from which the arrow originates is the predecessor, and the box to which the arrow head points is the successor.
As shown in the image, Logic Solvers are linked to Instrumented Functions, which store information about the specific functions associated with the Logic Solver. Logic Solvers are also linked to records in the following families:

SIS Proof Test
: Stores details of proof tests that are performed on logic solvers or instrumented functions. SIS Proof Tests can be linked to Functional Test Details, which store the detailed steps that need to be performed during proof tests.
SIS Proof Test Task
: Stores details of proof test tasks that are scheduled for logic solvers or instrumented functions. SIS Proof Test Tasks can be linked to SIS Proof Tests.
SIS Proof Test Template
: Stores details of the steps that should be taken when testing a logic solver or an instrumented function. When you create an SIS Proof Test, you can select an SIS Proof Test Template and the details from the SIS Proof Test Template will be populated in the SIS Proof Test.
SIS Proof Test Template ) records can be linked to SIS Proof Test Template Detail) records, which store details on the steps that need to be performed during the proof test.
The SIS Proof Test, SIS Proof Test Template, and Reference Document families participate as successors in other relationships within the SIS Management data model. This means that these families appear in another portion of the data model.
Protective Instrument Loop Data Model
The following diagram shows how the families used in a Protective Instrument Loop are related to one another.



Note: In the diagram, boxes represent entity families and arrows represent relationship families that are configured in the baseline database. You can determine the direction of the each relationship definition from the direction of the arrow head: the box from which the arrow originates is the predecessor, and the box to which the arrow head points is the successor.
The following protective instrument loop elements are defined in the GE Digital APM system:
Logic Solver Sensor System Sensor Group Sensor Final Element System Final Element Group Final Element 
By default, every protective instrument loop consists of at least one of each element. When you create a Protective Instrument Loop, the GE Digital APM system creates one record for each of these elements, and links to the Protective Instrument Loop as shown in the data model.
SRS Project Data Model
The following diagram shows how the families used in an SRS Project are related to one another.



Note: In the diagram, boxes represent entity families and arrows represent relationship families that are configured in the baseline database. You can determine the direction of the each relationship definition from the direction of the arrow head: the box from which the arrow originates is the predecessor, and the box to which the arrow head points is the successor.
SRS Project records are linked directly to records in the following families:

SIS Management Security Groups

The following table lists the baseline Security Groups available for users within this module, as well as the baseline Roles to which those Security Groups are assigned. In Predix APM, Roles are assigned to Security Users through permission sets.

Important:  Assigning a Security User to a Role grants that user the privileges associated with all of the Security Groups that are assigned to that Role. To avoid granting a Security User unintended privileges, before assigning a Security User to a Role, be sure to review all of the privileges associated with the Security Groups assigned to that Role.

SIS Management Site Filtering
In SIS Management, an SIL Analysis is assigned a site on the Definition workspace and spread to all the related records, such as Instrumented Function records and Logic Solver records.

Tip: For more information, refer to the Site Filtering section of the documentation.

In SIS Management, users will see only SIL Analysis that are assigned to their site(s) or that are global records.

Consider an organization that has three sites, Site X, Site Y, and Site Z. The following SIL Analysis records exist:
SIL Analysis A: Assigned to Site XSIL Analysis B: Assigned to Site YSIL Analysis C: Assigned to Site ZSIL Analysis D: No site assigned (global records)

Scenario 1: User assigned to only Site X

This user will see SIL Analysis A and SIL Analysis D.

Scenario 2: User assigned to both Site X and Site Y

This user will see SIL Analysis A, B and D.

Scenario 3: Super User

This user will see SIL Analysis A, B, C and D.
Important: If a multi-site user, or a Super User, links child records from multiple sites to a parent record designated as Global, another user who does not have access to all sites may only see a portion of the data associated with that record. In the example above, if a child record assigned to Site X and a child record assigned to Site Y are linked to SIL Analysis D, the Site X user will not be able to see all the records associated with SIL Analysis D.
About Reports in SIS ManagementThe SIS Management module provides the following types of baseline reports.
