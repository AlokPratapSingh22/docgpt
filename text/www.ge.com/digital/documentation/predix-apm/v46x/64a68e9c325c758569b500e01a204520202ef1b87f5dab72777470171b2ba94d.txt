Tag Instances







Tag InstancesAbout Tag InstancesTag instances are a name for sensor or calculated time series data. A tag instance represents a measurement from sensors, an analytic calculation, or asset-specific input. A tag instance can have many characteristics defined as separate attributes or properties. A tag instance inherits reserved attributes from its associated classification where common characteristics are defined. You can add a tag instance by associating it with the tag classification during ingestion, or you can add it to an asset instance. Tags are associated with a specific asset instance or classification, and may contain a time series link. A tag instance is accessed from the Tag link on an asset instance view. You can add custom attributes to the tag instance.Each tag instance view contains:The Tag Name and Description for the selected tag instance.The Associated Asset and Classification links for the select tag. Selecting the Classification link jumps to the Classifications sub-menu on the navigation bar for the selected tag. Selecting the Associated Asset link jumps to the asset instance view for the associated tag instance.The Status drop-down list box. Selections are Active, Inactive and Unknown.The Reserved and Custom Attributes tables for the selected tag instance. Custom Attributes and Reserved Attributes are modifiable.The Tag Aliases table for the selected tag instance. Tag Aliases are modifiable.The Tag Correlation section for the selected tag instance. Tag Correlations are configured during tag ingestion.Use the tag instance view to add or modify Custom Attributes, Reserved Attributes, or a Tag Alias for the selected tag instance. Tag Correlations are configured during tag ingestion and cannot be modified.Tag Modeler WorkflowThe tag modeler creates standard tag classifications and instances through APIs or ingestion for one or more JSONs.

The tag modeler can set up tags that include:ClassificationsInstances and connections to assetsGroups for classifications or instancesTo create a tag model for a tenant, do the following:Create tag classifications, which define the standard instances with common characteristics.Values for tagclassifications in the JSON include:idnamedescriptionNext, add values for reserved attributes. Adding values for reserved attributes to a classification allows sub-classifications to inherit those values. Values for reservedProperties and properties are added to the named tag classification node. Static attributes should be defined as part of the tag classification.Create tag instances and tag correlations.Tag instances represent specific tags associated with a type of tag classification, and connect to an asset instance.Note: You can associate a tag classification with an asset classification. When an asset instance is created from an asset classification, the asset instance automatically creates an appropriate tag instance where the tag classification was associated to the asset classification.Values for tagAssociations > monitoredEntity in the JSON include:idccomClassThe ccomClass vaue for monitoredEntity is predetermined according to their place in the hierarchy (ENTERPRISE, SITE, SEGMENT, or ASSET).Values for tagAssociations > tags in the JSON include:idnameclassificationreservedPropertiesaliasesnextRelatedTagValues for reservedProperties are added under the named tag instance. Dynamic attributes should be defined as part of the tag instance.Note: If the same attribute is defined at the class and instance levels, the attribute value defined in the instance takes precedence over the class.Values for classification are the tag classification. Values for aliases are alternative tag names. Values for nextRelatedTag are correlated tag names. Correlated tags capture the same measurement data but are labeled differently and may have different quality and density.Add group associations for the tag instances.Group associations include classifications of one type that are related or connected in some way. Groups include member tag instances which can be added in the JSON.Values for groups include:idnamedescriptionccomClassassociatedEntityCcomClasspropertiesassociatedEntityIdsThe ccomClass value is predefined as GROUP. The associatedEntityCcomClass value is the type (ENTERPRISE_TYPE, SITE_TYPE, SEGMENT_TYPE, or ASSET_TYPE) of the member instance listed under the group parent node. The members of the group are added using the sourcekey for associatedEntityIds.For more information, refer to the APIs or ingestion documentation to complete the workflow.Search for Tag InstancesYou can use a text string or modifiers to search for tag instances from an asset instance.About This Task
When you enter search criteria, the first 250 matching entries in the Search results table are displayed. Use modifiers to construct queries, narrowing your search.
The following columns are displayed in the Search results table:NameClassificationSource KeyDescription
Use three or more characters in your search text to avoid time-outs. You can use multiple modifiers when searching. When you perform the search with multiple query options or fewer search characters, your search scope is widened leading to slower result retrieval.
Note: If you want to search an asset or tag with the value that contains ,(comma), :(colon), or *(asterisk), you can search it only via wild card.For example: If you want to search an asset (that is, Turbine,test*123=0), you can search it as name=Turbine*. The assets starting with Turbine appears in the search result.
ProcedureIn the module navigation menu, go to
Assets >  Asset Instances.Use the Context Browser to select an asset context.Select the Tag link.To refine your search results use the following search modifiers:
Search ModifiersDescriptionname: tag instance display name
Enter a partial or full display name of a tag in the Search box, such as name: Hydro Turbine.Press Enter to activate the string in the Search box.
description: text describing a tag
Enter a partial or full description of a tag in the Search box, such as description: output asset.Press Enter to activate the string in the Search box.
sourceKey: unique identifier
Enter a partial or full source key for a tag in the Search box.Press Enter to activate the string in the Search box.
<attributeName>: attribute value
Enter the attribute name followed by a colon and the fully specified value in the Search box, such as manufacturer: GE or uom:ft.Press Enter to activate the string in the Search box.

If no results are found, the message "No Results Found" is displayed. If the search fails, the message "data failed to load" appears.Tip:
When using modifiers, you must match the modifier value exactly to get a result.When searching for a reserved attribute, you must use the fieldName to get a result. For a list of reserved attributes for Tag Instances, refer to the Add or Modify Reserved Attribute Values for a Tag Instance documentation.
Select Search.The instance options in the Search results table narrow according to your criteria.Sort Tag InstancesYou can sort tag instances of an enterprise, site, segment, or asset instance.Before You Begin
The following columns can be sorted by selecting the respective column headings:Tag NameTimeseries LinkSource IDUnitsTag DescriptionNote: You cannot sort the Status column.
About This TaskBy default, the tag instances appear in ascending order of the Tag Name. You can, however, sort the tags in the required order.ProcedureIn the module navigation menu, go to Assets > Asset Instances.Use the context browser to select an asset context.Select Tags.In the TAGS table, select the heading of the column that you want to sort.The tags are sorted in ascending order.Note: To change the order, you can select the column heading again.Filter Tag InstancesYou can filter tags by specifying filter criteria for a column to retrieve the tags matching the criteria.ProcedureIn the module navigation menu, go to Assets > Asset Instances.Use the context browser to select an asset context.Select Tags.In the TAGS table, in the Filter text box below the heading of the column that you want to filter, enter the criteria based on which you want to filter the column.The tags are filtered according to the filter criteria specified for the column.Download Tag InstancesYou can export all tag instances of an enterprise, site, segment, or asset instance to a .csv file along with the sort and filter order that you selected.ProcedureIn the module navigation menu, go to Assets > Asset Instances.Use the context browser to select an asset context.Select Tags.Select Export All Tags.ResultsAll tags with the displayed reserved attributes are exported to a .csv file along with the selected sort and filter order.Note: You cannot download cross-tenant granted tag instances.Select a Tag InstanceYou can select a tag instance from the Tag table to access and modify the tag instance.About This Task
