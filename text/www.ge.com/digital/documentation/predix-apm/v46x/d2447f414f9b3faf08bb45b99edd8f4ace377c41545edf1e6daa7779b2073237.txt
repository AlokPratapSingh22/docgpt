Microsoft SQL Server Analysis Services 2014Microsoft SQL Server Analysis Services 2016

If you are using an Oracle database, in order to process the Work History cube, you must install ODP.NET (Oracle Data Provider.NET), an Oracle Data Access Component, on the machine where the Work History cube is deployed. 

Deploying Metrics and Scorecards
You will need to perform some configuration steps specifically for Metrics and Scorecards. 
Note: For more information about performing the configuration steps, refer to the Deployment section of the Metrics and Scorecards documentation.
Metrics and Scorecards Security Groups

The following table lists the baseline Security Groups available for users within this module, as well as the baseline Roles to which those Security Groups are assigned. In Predix APM, Roles are assigned to Security Users through permission sets.

Important:  Assigning a Security User to a Role grants that user the privileges associated with all of the Security Groups that are assigned to that Role. To avoid granting a Security User unintended privileges, before assigning a Security User to a Role, be sure to review all of the privileges associated with the Security Groups assigned to that Role.

The baseline family-level privileges that exist for these Security Groups are summarized in the following table.

Metrics and Scorecards Data Model
 The following diagram illustrates how the entity and relationship families that are used in Metrics and Scorecards are related to one another. The shaded boxes represent entity families, and the arrows represent relationship families. You can determine the predecessor and successor in each relationship definition from the direction of the arrow head:The box from which the arrow originates is the predecessor in that relationship definition.The box to which the arrow head points in the successor in that relationship definition.
This family is not enabled for site filtering, which means that records in this family can be accessed by any user with the appropriate license and family privileges. For more information, refer to the Sites section of the documentation.



In this image, you can see that:
KPI records can be related to other KPI records through the Has Sub-Indicators relationship.The SSAS Servers family is not related to any other families. SSAS Servers record support Metric Views.The Analysis Services Cube family is not linked to any other KPI families. Analysis Services Cube records support Metric Views.
