This issue has been resolved.DE99126
Table 3. Known Issues and Limitations
The following issues have not been resolved in this release.
DescriptionTracking IDIf you point to a diagnostic marker on a SmartSignal chart, no information appears. To exit the mode and view the information about the marker, refresh the charts.DE101633When you have multiple y-axes enabled on a Time-Series chart, Y zoom and XY zoom provide an inconsistent user experience because all the axes do not scale correctly to reflect the zoomed-in state.DE104375When you delete tags on a Time-Series chart after you have plotted pin markers, the deleted tags appear in the marker data table. To prevent this issue, delete the tags, and then set the pins on the charts. DE95436While modifying the Time-Series chart in multiple y-axes mode, if you select Apply, your changes are neither applied nor visible in the chart settings. To prevent this issue, select Cancel, and then create the template for an ad hoc view. Alternatively, you can save the template, and then modify the existing template as needed. DE93811You must now use Google Chrome to add multiple charts to a SmartSignal card.Note: Other browsers, including Internet Explorer, do not support adding multiple charts to a single SmartSignal card.
