When you view an Inspection, you can create a new Inspection Team Member to link to the Inspection. Any user that has been assigned the Inspector role can be selected in the Inspection Team Member field. After the Inspection Team Member has been linked to the Inspection, the name in the Team Member field will be displayed in the inspection report.

Inspection Role Assignments 
To assign a role to a Security User, you will need to link a Resource Role record to the Human Resource record for that Security User. The Resource Role record contains the Role field, which should contain a value that indicates the role assigned to that user. 
For example, if John Smith is responsible for reviewing Inspection records, you would create a Human Resource record for John Smith and link it to a Resource Role record. That Resource Role record would contain the value Inspection Supervisor in the Role field.
Security Roles
The following security roles are used when you assign secured users to roles in the Security Manager. These security roles are assigned to specific states in State Configuration for Inspection Recommendation, and these roles are checked when users try to transition states.Security RoleDescriptionMI InspectorTransitions Inspection Recommendations from the Proposed state to the Pending Review or Superseded state.MI Inspection SupervisorTransitions Inspection Recommendations from the Pending Review state to the Proposed, Pending Approval, Cancelled, or Rejected state.SC Recommendation ReviewerTransitions Inspection Recommendations from the Pending Approval state to the Pending Review, Approved, Cancelled, or Rejected state.SC Recommendation ImplementerTransitions Inspection Recommendations from the Approved or In Progress state to the Completed state.Note: Super users can transition Inspection Recommendations between states without assigned security roles.
About CertificationsYou can indicate a user's certification level by creating a Personnel Certification to link to that user's Human Resource information. Details
When that user creates or approves an Inspection, the Certification will serve as documentation that the user is qualified to perform that task. Because Inspections are often used as legal documentation to prove that an inspection took place, recording the responsible party's qualifications is an important step.
