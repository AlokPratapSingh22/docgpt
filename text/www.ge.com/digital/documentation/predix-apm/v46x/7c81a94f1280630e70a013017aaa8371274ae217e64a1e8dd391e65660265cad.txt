In the Family box, select the family whose records you want to search.Optionally, in the Linked To box, select a family that is related to the family that you selected in the Family box. If you do so, the search will return only the records that both belong to the family in the Family box and are linked to another record belonging to a family in the Linked To box.If you selected a family in the Linked To box, then, in the Through box, select the type of relationship that should exist between the family selected in the Family box and the family selected in the Linked To box. When you run the search, the results will contain only records that are linked via the specified relationship. If only one type of relationship exists between the selected families, the Through box will be populated automatically with that relationship.Optionally, define field conditions. Note that defining field conditions limits advanced search results to only records whose field values match the specified criteria.
