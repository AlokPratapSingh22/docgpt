InspectionsAbout InspectionsInspections are a way to document, manage, and analyze data associated with the inspections of equipment and locations in your facility.About Types of InspectionsYou will record the results of each inspection in an Inspection and its linked successors. The baseline GE Digital APM database contains Inspection families that you can use for recording the results of each type of inspection.Details
Using Inspection Management, you can record inspection results for the following types of inspections:
Shell and tube heat exchanger inspections.General routine inspections performed against any piece of equipment or location for compliance purposes.General routine inspections performed against any piece of equipment or location by operators versus inspectors (does not necessarily meet compliance standards).Hydrostatic tests (i.e., the process of filling a pressure vessel with liquid, such as water, and increasing the internal pressure to test for leaks).External and internal pressure vessel inspections (following API 510 standards).Internal exchanger inspections (following API 510 standards).External piping inspections (following API 570 standards).External and internal tank inspections (following API 653 standards).External visual inspections of pressure relief devices (PRDs).External functional inspections of PRDs (following API 576 standards).
Baseline Inspection Families
The following table lists the baseline Inspection families and the type of inspection to which each corresponds.

About Inspection Reports
The baseline Inspection Management module includes reports that can be used to view information about an inspection. When you view an Inspection report, you are viewing a main report and various subreports that exist in the Catalog. These reports are based on supporting queries that gather information from the Inspection record and records to which it is linked.
The following table lists the main reports that correspond with each Inspection subfamily, the query and subreports that are associated with each main report, and the sections that are included in each main report. Note that the subreports are not meant to be run independently of the associated main report.

Interpreting Inspection Reports 
In the baseline database, one report is provided for each of the following Inspection families:
Checklists Bundle Inspection Full Inspection General Inspection Pressure Test Inspection 
Note:  The Checklist Inspection report is configured for each Checklists subfamily (for example, API 510 External Checklist).
While each family has its own report, many of the sections in the reports are common to all of the reports. This section of the documentation describes the sections that are included in the baseline reports and indicates whether or not the section is common to all reports.
Asset Corrosion AnalysisThe Asset Corrosion Analysis section appears when an Asset Corrosion Analysis in Thickness Monitoring is linked to the inspection for which you are generating a report. This section displays information that is stored in the Asset Corrosion Analysis. An example of the Asset Corrosion Analysis section is shown in the following image.The following table lists the items that are included in the Asset Corrosion Analysis section and their corresponding fields.

Since the subcomponents that you will need to inspect will differ based upon the type of inspection that you are performing, the items that appear in the Inspection Finding Checklist will differ based upon the Inspection subfamily.Checklist Details 
The baseline Inspection families are:
Checklist Inspection TemplateExternal Checklist Internal Checklist Internal Exchanger Checklist PRD Pop Test Checklist 
Each of these families is hard-coded to use a particular System Code Table to create the finding sections and rows that appear in the grid on the Inspection Findings Checklist page. The sections and rows on the Inspection Findings Checklist page are built from System Code Tables and referenced System Codes.
Note: The Checklist Inspection Template family is not hard-coded to include specific Checklist Findings. The Checklist Findings are defined by the checklist categories and items for the Checklist Configuration Template.
Tip:  If you create custom Checklists subfamilies, you must add the Checklist System Code Table ID field (i.e., a field in the Checklists family) to the custom family. 
Example: API 653 External Checklist Findings
The baseline GE Digital APM database contains the following System Code Table:

ID: MI API 653 EXTERNAL CHECKLIST FINDING SECTIONS
Description: API 653 External Checklist Finding Section
This System Code Table contains the following System Codes:
General Connections Supports 
Each of the System Codes that belong to this System Code Table contain referenced System Codes. For example, the System Code Supports contains the following referenced System Codes:
Anchor Bolts Dike/Retaining Wall Foundation Other 
Together, the System Code Tables, System Codes, and referenced System Codes determine which sections and rows you will see on the Inspection Finding Checklist page. Using this example:
Each System Code belonging to the System Code Table MI API 653 EXTERNAL CHECKLIST FINDING SECTIONS becomes a finding section.In each finding section, each referenced System Code becomes a separate row.
Each field within the checklist can be modified by the user to best fit the work process.
About Active and Archived InspectionsInspections that are still in the process of being completed or reviewed are referred to as Active Inspections.Archived Inspections are Inspections that have been reviewed, locked, and archived. Locking the Inspection record ensures that the information that you supplied will not be deleted or modified. After you lock an Inspection record, you cannot unlock it. You can lock Inspection records defined for any of the following families by accessing Record Manager. Bundle InspectionFull InspectionGeneral InspectionPressure Test Sub-InspectionAbout Inspection Intervals An inspection interval identifies the length of time between Equipment inspections. Various factors will impact the inspection intervals that you will define at various levels in your location hierarchy.About Inspection Intervals
When populating the value in the Desired Interval field in Inspection Tasks, the GE Digital APM System uses the value stored in the Time-Based Inspection Interval Settings that you defined.
Example: Inspection Intervals
For example, jurisdictional regulations might dictate that a particular inspection must be conducted every two months. However, your organizational policy might dictate that this particular inspection be conducted every 30 days. In this case, you would define an inspection interval of 30 days.
About Inspection Health EvaluationsInspection Health Evaluations allow you to assign Health Assessment values to Inspections and Inspection Checklist Categories. When the Health Evaluations admin setting is enabled for an Inspection Event Family, the Health Evaluation icon is available for new inspections created in the same Inspection Event Family.Note: When updating a Health Assessment for a Checklist Category, the Health Assessment of the root Inspection is updated to the worst-case indicator level of the Checklist Categories that are associated with it.About Image GalleryYou can access the images stored within reference documents of a record in the image gallery. The gallery is provided in the inspection, its related records, and checklist categories. The image gallery displays images that have either been directly stored as reference documents within GE Digital APM or provided as a reference document with an external network path.The Description text box contains the value entered in the Description field of the currently selected reference document. This text box is disabled. If the currently selected reference document is related to either a General Finding or a Checklist Finding record, the Finding Summary text box contains the value entered in the Finding Summary field of the finding record. This text box is disabled.Access the Inspection Data SectionProcedure

You can now make adjustments to the Inspection Checklist section by accessing the Record Manager. 
Create an InspectionBefore You Begin
If the asset that you are using does not have any existing inspections, you must access it through the Asset Hierarchy. 
Note: The following steps apply to both creating an inspection and creating a checklist inspection.
Procedure
