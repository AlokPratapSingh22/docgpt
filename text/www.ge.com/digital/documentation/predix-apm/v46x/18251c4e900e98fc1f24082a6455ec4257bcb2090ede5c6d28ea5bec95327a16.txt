ActionsAbout ActionsIn a System Reliability Analysis, an Action represents an operation that can be performed against a piece of equipment, location, or a switch. Actions can represent inspections, general maintenance, or specific events that mitigate Risks, such as training or procedures.Actions can be unique events that happen only once during a simulation period, or they can be repeated at certain times during the simulation period. You can optionally assign Resources to Actions to associate a specific cost with the Action. When you assign Resources to Actions, a System Resource Usage record will be created.Details
Actions in System Reliability Analyses are stored in the following records, which can be linked to System Asset and System Switch records:

 System Condition Monitor Records: Store information about continuous, condition-based maintenance Actions. An example of this type of Action would be an Action that continuously monitors the level of fluid in a gauge.
 System Inspection Records: Store information about periodic, condition-based maintenance Actions. An example of this type of Action is the Vibration Analysis Action in Scenario B of our System Reliability Analysis Example.
 System Preventive Maintenance Records: Store information about time-based maintenance Actions. An example of this type of Action is the Replace Seals Action in Scenario B of our System Reliability Analysis Example.
 System Special Action Records: Store information about procedural, redesign, or training Actions. An example of this type of Action is the Redesign Impeller Action in Scenario B of our System Reliability Analysis Example.
About Actions and Risks
After you create an Action in a System Reliability Analysis, you can assign a single Risk or multiple Risks to that Action. When you assign a Risk to an Action, a link is created between a System Risk Assessment record, which stores the GUID of the mitigated Risk in the Risk GUID field, and the Action. This allows the Action to mitigate the Risk. An Action may mitigate a Risk by changing certain properties, such as failure consequences or the failure distribution, of the Risk.
                               Actions mitigate Risks in different ways depending on the type of Action that is assigned to the Risk. The different types of Actions mitigate Risks in the following ways:
                                
Preventive Maintenance Action: Can mitigate the Time to Fail (TTF) distribution of the Risk by increasing the maximum operating time of the Risk, as defined by the fields in the Distribution record that defines the TTF distribution associated with the Risk. For example, the Replace Seal Action in Scenario B of the System Reliability Analysis Example mitigates the Seal Failure Risk by creating more operating time by replacing the existing seals, which have a smaller amount of operating time, with new seals that have a larger amount of operating time.
Condition Monitor or Inspection Action: Can mitigate the consequences of failure by fixing potential failures before they occur. This allows proactive repairs, or planned corrections, to be made to the system instead of fixing a failure using an unplanned correction. Planned corrections can consume less Resources and lower the costs of a Scenario. For example, the Vibration Analysis Action in Scenario B of the System Reliability Analysis Example mitigates the Bearing Failure Risk by identifying a potential Bearing Failure and executing a planned correction, which requires less Resources and less Resource usage than executing an unplanned correction.
Special Action: Can mitigate the failure consequences of the Risk, as defined in the Fixed Unplanned Correction Cost field of the System Risk record, and the TTF distribution, as defined by the Distribution record that represents the TTF distribution associated with the Risk. For example, the occurrence of the Redesign Impeller Action in Scenario B of the System Reliability Analysis Example mitigates the Impeller Failure by reducing the fixed unplanned correction cost and extending the TTF distribution of the Impeller Failure Risk.
Note: An Action does not have to mitigate a Risk, but associating an Action with a Risk and mitigating the Risk creates a more reliable system.

About Action OptimizationAction Optimization allows you to optimize a group of actions associated with an analysis to determine the optimum interval at which to perform an inspection or preventative maintenance. After you have found the optimal interval for an action, you can apply it to that action. When you do so, in the Actions section of the workspace for the System Reliability Analysis, the value in the Interval field in the System Action record will be overwritten with the value that exists in the Optimal Interval field. After you apply the optimal interval, you can then run the simulation for the System Reliability Analysis to update the results based upon the optimized interval.Add a Periodic Condition-Based Maintenance ActionProcedure
