Corrosion LoopAbout the Risk Based Inspection (RBI) Corrosion Loop Data Loader
GE Digital APM, through the Risk Based Inspection module, provides the functionality to carry out a Semi-Quantitative Analysis (RBI Criticality Analysis) on Corrosion Loops, which are comprised of various types of linked RBI Components. Using the Risk Based Inspection (RBI) Corrosion Loop Data Loader, you can generate all Corrosion Loops for a Process Unit along with the related RBI Components and Reference Documents.Using the Risk Based Inspection (RBI) Corrosion Loop Data Loader, you can create or update Corrosion Loops, link RBI Components, and Reference Documents.About the Risk Based Inspection (RBI) Corrosion Loop Data Loader RequirementsThis documentation assumes that your organization has completed fully the deployment of the Risk Based Inspection module. The Risk Based Inspection (RBI) Corrosion Loop Data Loader should only be used after the Risk Based Inspection module has been implemented.The data loader can be used to set up an RBI program during implementation. Because the RBI Components must exist prior to the Corrosion Loop data load, the Risk Based Inspection (RBI) 580 Data Loader should be used before the Risk Based Inspection (RBI) Corrosion Loop Data Loader.When you create or update a Corrosion Loop, it is linked to a Functional Location, which must already exist, and then linked to Criticality RBI Components and Reference Documents that you specify.The following data must be defined prior to loading Corrosion Loop data:Site ReferencesEquipment Taxonomies
Functional Location Families
Security Settings
The Security User performing the data load operation must be associated with either the MI Data Loader User or MI Data Loader Admin Security Role, and must also be associated with the MI RBI Analyst Security Group or a Security Role that is associated with this Security Group.

About the Risk Based Inspection (RBI) Corrosion Loop Data Loader General Loading StrategyBest Practices
When importing data using the Risk Based Inspection (RBI) Corrosion Loop Data Loader, you must use the following best practices:
 ID fields (Row 2 of each worksheet) must not include special characters or spaces.The data loader workbook contains sample data in each column. It is only for your reference. You must remove this data before using the data loader workbook.Columns (including columns representing custom fields) in the worksheets should be formatted as Text.Import a maximum of 500 records in each data load.For Oracle databases, valid cell values are case-sensitive.For a Corrosion Loop to have associated RBI Components, the RBI Components that will be linked to the Corrosion Loop must already exist in the GE Digital APM system.If RBI Components do not exist, the Corrosion Loop Data Loader will create or update Corrosion Loop data, but it will not have any associated RBI Components.
Load Sequence
The RBI Corrosion Loop data load is performed in a specific sequence to create all necessary relationships between records:
Note:  Prior to deploying the Risk Based Inspection (RBI) Corrosion Loop Data Loader, the Risk Based Inspection (RBI) 580 Data Loader must be implemented. The Corrosion Loop Data Loader uses the values in the Functional Location field, the Corrosion Loop field, the Asset field, and the Component field to look up the associated component record and to link said RBI Component to a Corrosion Loop. . For RBI Components to be linked to a Corrosion Loop, the RBI Components must already exist and be present in the Components worksheet. If RBI Components do not exist, the Corrosion Loop Data Loader will create or update Corrosion Loop data, but it will not have any associated RBI Components.
The Corrosion Loops worksheet is processed. An existing Functional Location will be looked up based on the Functional Location (MI_FNCLOC00_FNC_LOC_C) and the RBI Corrosion Loop ID (MI_RBI_SYSTEM_RBI_SYS_ID_C).If a Corrosion Loop specified on the worksheets exists, it will be updated. If a Corrosion Loop cannot be found, then a new Corrosion Loop will be created.The RBI Components worksheet is processed. An existing RBI Component is looked up based on the below fields: Asset ID (For Equipment: MI_EQUIP000_EQUIP_ID_C and for Functional Location: MI_FNCLOC00_FNC_LOC_C)Asset CMMS System (For Equipment:MI_EQUIP000_SAP_SYSTEM_C and for Functional Location: MI_FNCLOC00_SAP_SYSTEM_C)Equipment Technical Number (MI_EQUIP000_EQUIP_TECH_NBR_C)Asset FamilyComponent (MI_RBICOMPO_COMPO_C)Component Type (MI_RBICOMPO_COMPO_TYPE_C)If found, the RBI Component will be linked to the specified Corrosion Loop (MI_RBI_SYSTEM_RBI_SYS_ID_C). If no RBI Components exist, this worksheet is skipped. If the RBI Component is specified in the worksheet, but that RBI Component cannot be looked up, an error is added to the log. Note: When an RBI Component is linked to a Corrosion Loop, the Potential Degradation Mechanisms linked to the Corrosion Loop are added to the RBI Component.The Reference Document worksheet is processed. The Corrosion Loop will be looked up by the Functional Location (MI_FNCLOC00_FNC_LOC_C), the RBI Corrosion Loop (MI_RBI_SYSTEM_RBI_SYS_ID_C), and the Reference Document ID (CTIT_ID).If a Reference Document specified on the worksheet exists, it is updated. If a Reference Document cannot be found, then a new Reference Document is created.
Data that you specify in the field on each worksheet will be included in the new records.
About the Risk Based Inspection (RBI) Corrosion Loop Data Loader Workbook Layout and Use
In order to import data using the Risk Based Inspection (RBI) Corrosion Loop Data Loader, GE Digital APM provides an Excel workbook, Risk Based Inspection (RBI) Corrosion Loop.xlsx, which supports baseline Risk Based Inspection in GE Digital APM. This workbook must be used to perform the data load. You can modify the Excel workbook to include custom fields used by your organization.
Note: The Excel workbook is referred to throughout this documentation as the data loader workbook.
The following table lists the worksheets that are included in the data loader workbook.
WorksheetDescriptionCorrosion_LoopsThis worksheet is used to specify which Corrosion Loops the user wants to link to Functional Locations.ComponentsThis worksheet is used only to lookup fields for unique, existing RBI Components to link to Corrosion Loops.Reference_DocumentThis worksheet is used to specify the Functional Location key fields as well as the Corrosion Loop key fields.
Color Coding
Certain columns on the worksheets have different functions and requirements. To illustrate this, certain columns are color-coded. The following table lists the colors and what they represent.

Color

Description

Comments

Gray

Required Key Fields

Indicates columns that contain values that are used by the Risk Based Inspection (RBI) Corrosion Loop Data Loader to look up and create records. If these columns are removed from the worksheets, the data load will fail. While the worksheets require that these columns be present, values are not necessarily required in these columns.

Red

Fields Required for Saving Records

Indicates columns that contain values that are required to save the record.

Blue

Recommended Fields

Indicates columns that, according to GE Digital APM Best Practice for Inspection Management, should contain values.

Limitations
The Risk Based Inspection (RBI) Corrosion Loop Data Loader has the following limitations:
The values that you enter in the data loader workbook are case-sensitive.
If you reimport data, the records that have been created by the Data Loader will be updated. Therefore, while reimporting data, if you remove the data for a field in the data loader workbooks, the value for the corresponding field in GE Digital APM will be either a default value or blank.

About the Risk Based Inspection (RBI) Corrosion Loop Data Loader Load VerificationAbout This TaskFollowing a data load, you should perform the following steps in GE Digital APM to confirm the integrity and accuracy of the data imported from the data loader workbook.ProcedureAccess the details of the import job. These details will indicate if any errors, minor or otherwise, were encountered during the import job. The log may help account for any records that are unexpectedly absent after the data load.In Risk Based Inspection or Record Manager, access the Corrosion Loops specified in the data loader workbook, and then verify that the expected components are present or updated, and that any associated records that you expected to be created are also present in the database.
You can enter the following query in the SQL workspace of the Query page to review a list of components created after a specified date:
