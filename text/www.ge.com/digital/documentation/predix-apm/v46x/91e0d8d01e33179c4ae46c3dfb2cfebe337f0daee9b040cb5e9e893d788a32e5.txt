Automation RulesAbout Automation RulesReliability Distribution and Reliability Growth Analyses can be generated interactively or through Reliability Automation Rules. These rules can generate multiple Reliability Analyses for an entire hierarchy of equipment and locations that have related events or for a list of equipment that are returned by a query.Using Reliability Automation Rules, you can analyze an entire family or elements of several families in a single step. Based on the parameters that you define for the automation rule query, the system will automatically generate the analysis calculations and generate the appropriate reliability analyses. The calculations can be based on an entire selected family, or on the results of a query, which could contain members of multiple families. Note: To generate a Reliability Analysis, equipment and location families and failure data for the equipment and location must already be defined in the database.About Creating Queries for Use with the Automation Rule BuilderIn the Reliability Automation Rule Builder window, you can select an existing query to provide the data on which auto-generated Reliability Analyses will be built for a query-based Automation Rule. Before you can use the Reliability Automation Rule Builder window, one or more appropriate queries must be defined.Note: After these queries have been created and used to build rules, they should not be deleted. Without the queries, the Automation Rules that are based on them cannot update the analyses that they generated.Details
Automation Rule queries must contain:

All of the fields needed for mapping to the selected analysis type (Reliability Distribution, Reliability Growth). For all analysis types, the following fields should be selected:
Asset ID (required).Asset Installation Date (optional).Failure Date (required).Downtime (optional).
The fields that will be used for grouping populations of events (including system fields such as Family ID and Family Key and the entity family caption)Filtering criteria.
Note: Filtering is disabled in the Reliability Automation Rule Builder if a query is used to build analyses.
We recommend that you use a query that contains the metadata information in the Asset ID and Failure Date fields (which are required fields) and that these two fields are defined in two separate entity families. This precludes the use of Group By queries, complex (non metadata-based) queries in the SQL Editor, and system fields or calculated fields for Asset ID and Failure Date information.
The master query cannot contain parameters. The master query should be stored in a public directory in the Catalog and must not be deleted. We recommend that you store this query in the GE Digital APM Catalog in the following folder: \\Public\Meridium\Modules\ReliabilityManager.
If you require additional fields for mapping or population grouping in the Reliability Automation Rule, you must change the master query. The master query should be accessible to members of the MI Reliability Administrators Security Group who will be working with Reliability Automation Rules. When the Reliability Automation Rule is executed to generate the analyses, sub-queries will be created using the master query as the source. If the master query is deleted, the sub-queries will cease to operate.
Access an Automation RuleProcedure
Access the RA Overview page. Select the Automation Rules tab.
A list of Reliability Automation Rules available in the database appears.



In the list, select the hyperlink of a Reliability Automation Rule that you want to view.
The Automation page appears, displaying the following tabs:


Definition: Contains a description of the criteria that identifies the rule, including the type of analysis that will be generated from the rule. 
If the rule is based on a query, the Rule Basis field will read Query and the Query field that specifies the related query the rule uses. 
If the rule is based on Asset-Event data structure, the name of the family for Family-based events (i.e. Rule Basis, Asset Family, Event Family, and the relationship between the Asset and Event families) will be displayed in this section. If filters or groupings have been applied to the rule, they will also be included in this section. 

Rule Information
: Contains a list of analyses that will be generated when you run the rule. This tab is selected by default. The following columns provide details on each of the analyses:
Analysis Name: Contains the list of analyses. You can select the name of the desired analysis.
Number of Assets: Contains the number of assets included in the analysis.
Number of Failure Events: Contains the number of Failure events for the specified Asset.
A Reliability Analysis will be created for each potential analysis listed that contains a minimum of two failure events the next time the automated rule is executed. You can select any link in the list to view a preview of the data that will be included in that analysis.

For Reliability Automation Rules based on an Asset-Event data structure, the name of the analysis is populated automatically by the GE Digital APM system based on the name of the Asset family that you selected on the Choose an Asset Family builder screen.

If you made no selections on the Select Population Grouping screen, the GE Digital APM system will use only the Asset family name as the name of the analysis.
If you make Group By selections on the Select Population Grouping screen, the GE Digital APM system will append the name of each member of the selected population group(s) on this screen to the name of the analysis. For example, suppose that Equipment is the name of the selected equipment/location family. If you selected the Manufacturer field for population grouping, the name of each manufacturer is listed next to the Equipment family name.


For Reliability Automation Rules based on a query, the name of the analysis is populated automatically using values that correspond to the fields you selected on the Select Population Grouping screen. If you did not select any groupings, the new analysis will be named New Analysis.
