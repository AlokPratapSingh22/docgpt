Table 2. Known Issues
The following enhancements and new features have been added.
DescriptionTracking IDWhen you have multiple Y-axes enabled on a time series chart, Y zoom and XY Zoom provide an inconsistent user experience because all the axes do not scale correctly to reflect the zoomed-in state.DE104375If you click on a diagnostic marker on a SmartSignal chart, the hover information on the markers does not appear. In order to get out of the mode, you can refresh the charts and the hover information reappears.DE101633If you enable the cross-hair mode in an analysis and then added new charts to the template, the cross-hair information is not reflected on the new charts, and the cross-hair markers are no longer visible on the existing charts. To prevent this, disable cross-hair mode, add the charts, and then enable cross-hair mode again.DE99126When you delete tags on a time series chart after you have plotted pin markers, the deleted tags appear in the marker data table. The workaround for this is to delete the tags, and then set the pins on the charts.DE95436When making changes to the time series chart in multiple Y-axes mode, select Cancel, not Apply. If you select Apply, the changes are not applied nor are they visible in chart settings. The workaround for this is to select Cancel and to create the template for an ad-hoc view. Or, save the template, and then make your changes for an existing template.DE93811
