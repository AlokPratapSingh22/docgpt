What To Do NextAfter you have entered all the details, Save the Asset Technical Data for an asset. You can create multiple Asset Technical Data for an asset. The steps above are based on Asset Type Pressure Vessel with a Shell Chamber selection.Apply Suggested Compliance Strategy Templates for an AssetUsers can get suggested Compliance Strategy Templates for assets that are in the Assets without Templates section of the Compliance Management Overview page. This section contains assets that do not have linked Compliance Strategy Templates, but match queries attached to Compliance Strategy Templates. Before You BeginProcedureAccess the Compliance Management Overview page, and then select the Assets without Templates tab.The Assets without Templates section appears.Select Suggest Templates.A window appears, stating that the current Suggested Compliance Template records will be deleted if you proceed.Select Yes.The Suggest Templates process executes. A scheduled job is created.Optional: If you want to view the status of the job, select . The Schedule Logs page appears, displaying a list of all the operations in GE Digital APM that are in progress, along with the percentages of completion. You can also access a list of operations that have been successful or have failed.After selecting Suggested Template, refresh the page. Select the check boxes next to the Asset IDs, and then select Apply Template. The Confirm Apply Template window appears asking you to confirm if you want to apply the suggested templates to the selected assets.Select Yes.The templates are applied to the selected assets, and the assets appear in the Assets without Inspection Plans section of the Compliance Management Overview page.Results
Note: For European Inspection Compliance, GE Digital APM has 8 Compliance Strategy Templates that are available for use. When assets are added, the query is added to the Compliance Strategy Template record and is saved for later use. If a Compliance Strategy Template does not have a query attached to the record, it is excluded from the Suggest Templates job. Additionally, if an asset does not match a query that is attached to a Compliance Strategy Template, it will not receive a suggested Compliance Strategy Template.
Create an Inspection Plan from the Compliance Management Overview PageYou can create an Inspection Plan for assets that are linked to Compliance Strategy Templates.Before You BeginThe assets must have one or more Compliance Strategy Templates linked to them.ProcedureAccess Compliance Management, and then select the Assets without Inspection Plans tab.The Assets without Inspection Plans section appears, displaying a list of available assets based on the current filter.In the Assets section, select the check boxes against the rows containing the asset to create an Inspection Plan.The selected assets are highlighted.Select Create Inspection Plans.The job status appears in the page heading, displaying the progress of the Inspection Plan creation.Note: When the process is complete, you can select  to access the Schedule Logs page.Approve an Inspection Plan ProcedureAccess the Inspection Plan that you want to approve.Once an Inspection Plan is created for an asset, the asset along with other assets appears in Assets with Inspection Plans tab.Select the asset.The Inspection Plan page appears for the selected asset.Select Proposed, followed by Approve and then Done.A message appears, stating that the Inspection Plan has been approved. Note:
The inspection plan is promoted as a strategy in ASM. You can view the strategy in ASM by selecting Open Strategy.After you approve an Inspection Plan, you cannot delete, supersede, or designate recommendations as Not Required. You must first move them to the Modified state.While the Inspection Plan is being modified, you cannot delete, supersede, or designate recommendations as Not Required. 
Implement an Inspection PlanBefore You Begin
Ensure that the Implement Recommended Actions to Tasks in ASM setting is set to False in the Inspection Configuration section of the IM Admin Preferences page.You must have an Inspection Plan that is in the Approved state.
About This Task

ProcedureYou can view if the state of the Inspection Plan from the top-right corner of the page. Select the check box against the recommendation that you want to implement and select Implement from the top-right corner of the page.
Note: You can perform only one implementation at a time. Select a recommendation using the check box to implement. Bulk implemented is not allowed. For more information on Recommendation Details, see Recommendation ID.
The Implement as Inspection Task dialog appearsYou can implement as a new task or link it to an existing task.Here, we are implementing all the three tasks as new tasks.

As needed, modify the details for the Recommended Actions that you selected.All the three recommendations of the asset have been implemented as new task and are visible in Existing Tasks section of the page.The Inspection Plan page appears. Manage Inspection TasksBefore You Begin
Ensure that you have implemented an Inspection Plan. For more information on Implementing an Inspection Task, refer to the Implement an Inspection Plan topic.
About This Task
This topic describes how to create and manage a European Inspection Task. The European Inspection Task is introduced to the Inspection Task family to manage the European Inspection tasks, according to the Compliance regulation.
ProcedureSelect any one task from the Task ID column in Inspection Plan.The Inspection Task datasheet appears.Select the European Inspection Task datasheet from the Datasheet ID drop-down list.The European Inspection Task record appears for the asset.As needed, enter values in the available fields  of the datasheet.
For more information on the Mappings, refer to the European Technical Data and Compliance Recommendation Mappings topic. The following fields are available as part of the Inspection Event.FieldValueSourceApplicable Regulation If the inspection is a European Inspection, then you need to select European Inspection Regulation. The values in this field are populated from the MI_INTGY_REGULATION system code table. Compliance RecommendationCertification The values in this field are populated from the MI_COMPLIANCE_STANDARDS system code table. By default, it shows ZUS and BP.Compliance RecommendationPrevious Next DateThis field is populated automatically by the GE Digital APM system. This filed stores the Next Date before the rescheduling occurs. This field is always disabled.European InspectionTask Rescheduling BasisThis field captures the information based on how the Next Date field is calculated. The field can be calculated either by the Completion Date or the Previous Next Date. European InspectionCompliance WindowThis field stores the information about the duration of compliance in months.European Admin SettingsInspection Documentation WindowThis field stores information about the duration in months for documenting an inspection report.European Admin Settings
Compliance Min Date
The earliest date on which an inspection may be performed.European InspectionCompliance Max DateThe time between the Last Date and the Max Date.European Inspection
Note:
The Applicable Regulation and Certification field values are mapped from the related Compliance Recommendation record from which the Inspection Task was created.The Applicable Regulation value is set to European Inspection Regulation and the Certification field value is set to ZUS, then the Inspectors with respective certification or Inspection Administrators will be able to select the Modifiable Task field. If the Certification field value is set to ZUS, certification for the inspector will not be checked to select the modifiable task attribute. Value in the fields Compliance Window and Inspection Documentation Window in European Inspection Task datasheet are auto populated from European Admin Settings. These values must be pre-defined at a Site Level.If the Certification field value is set, then Modifiable field will set to false before updating the Inspection Task.

Reschedule an Inspection Task You can reschedule an Inspection Task after completing an Inspection Event. For an Inspection Task that have the Applicable Regulation set to European Inspection Regulation, the Next Date is updated in an Inspection Task based on the following two scenarios: 
Scenario 1: For Completion Date before Compliance Min Date
Next Date field on Inspection Task is set based on the value in the Completion Date + Desired Interval. Task Rescheduling Basis field on Inspection Task will be updated to Next Date  based on Last Date.

Scenario 2: For Completion Date after Compliance Min Date
Next Date field on Inspection Task is set based on the value in the Previous Next Date + Desired
Interval. Task Rescheduling Basis field on Inspection Task will be updated to  Next Date based on Next Date.
The above two scenarios are explained in a form of an example. The following table is used as an example to calculate the Next Date of an Inspection Task Details before any rescheduling.
