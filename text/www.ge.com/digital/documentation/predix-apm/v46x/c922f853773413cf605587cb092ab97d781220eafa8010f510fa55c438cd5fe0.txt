ChartsAbout ChartsUse and modify charts to suit special circumstances during analysis.You can use charts to evaluate asset data using different views.When you select an asset, the system retrieves the default view for assets of this class. To plot tags from the default view, you must search for tags using the Search field. You can save the analysis view, making it available as an Analysis Template in the view selector.When creating a chart, you can plot data for one or more assets and child assets. You can plot tags that use a different unit of measure, displaying multiple y-axis numbering systems. You can select a data source, timezone preference, and chart resolution. Charts can be zoomed or panned.Important: Data resolution and date range selected are related. You can create multiple different chart-types on a single card in the Ad Hoc Analysis view.When a plotted tag is assigned a color, that color is associated with that tag. The tag is plotted with that color on every chart for which it is displayed.Access a Chart from an AlertYou can use an Analysis View template to review performance charts associated with an alert and to gather evidence to help resolve the alert. About This Task
When an asset source connects to the time-series database, designated analytics parse the data using threshold values. If one or more threshold values are not met, GE Digital APM generates an alert. The system checks for an associated alert template as it creates the alert. When you navigate to the Alert Inbox and select the alert, a list of associated chart views under the Analysis section appear. Select a chart to access the Analysis View in a new page.
Asset Data and SmartSignal alerts both use analysis chart templates to create an Analysis View chart. 
Analysis View templates automatically populate an asset, a time range, and a default view for the chart. The list of plotted tags is based on the alert template in use. When an alert template does not exist, the list of plotted tags is retrieved in the alert.
You can share a filter from an Analysis View Chart. Filters can be value-based or conditional and are shared to other analysis templates.
You can add predefined or custom threshold lines to a chart. Custom threshold lines are configurable.
SmartSignal alerts include both contributing tags (tags that have contributed to the alert) and non-contributing tags (participated in the analytic for which the advisory was created).
When you select a SmartSignal Analysis View chart in an alert, all of the generated alerts for the selected asset are visible in the Tag Browser.
Some of the modification options you can use are listed below:Find additional tags.Plot additional tags.Change the date range.Mute or unmute data on the chart.Zoom in on an area on a chart.View data in a tooltip.Display tag information.Save a chart as evidence to an alert.Display only the real values for tags.Display only analytics predicted value for tags.Add threshold lines to a chart.Update the Analysis View template.
ProcedureNavigate to an analysis view using one of the following methods:

One or more charts depending upon your alert and analysis chart template selection appear in the Analysis module. Customer Data Center data renders as a single chart, while SmartSignal data renders as a dynamic stack of charts. When you access the charts, if one or more charts fail to load, a notification bar appears displaying the count of the charts that failed to load for the selected card. Select Retry to reload the charts completely and only the failed charts are reloaded. You can also retry loading the data for a specific failed chart.Note: Select  to close the notification bar of the charts that failed to load.Modify the chart as needed.

Use the timeline slider to zoom, narrowing the date range and eliminating extraneous chart data. Use the zoom panel to zoom incrementally along the X-axis, Y-axis, or both axes.About This Task
You can zoom chart data for both a Time Series Analysis and an Event Data Analysis view.
When you zoom in on chart data by selecting the data, the date range on the timeline slider adjusts to the narrowed parameters. The date range selected for the view does not change.
The zoom panel allows to you zoom in or out incrementally for the X-axis, Y-axis, or both axes, expanding or contacting in the center of the chart. Note: When you zoom in to any chart, by default the chart gets magnified in the XY mode.You can undo the last zoom command or reset the zoom in the zoom panel. Zooming on the Y-axis only allows you to control the range of values that are relevant for the analysis. Zooming on the X-axis only allows you to control the time range available for analysis. Zooming for individual axes is limited to Time Series and X-Y charts only.
The chart timeline slider, located at the bottom of each chart, mirrors the date range selected for the chart. You can hide some of the data visible on the chart by narrowing the time range. 
Zooming resets the data resolution to default or the actual number of data points, whichever is less. 
If there are multiple charts in the view, zooming one of the charts magnifies the remaining charts.
