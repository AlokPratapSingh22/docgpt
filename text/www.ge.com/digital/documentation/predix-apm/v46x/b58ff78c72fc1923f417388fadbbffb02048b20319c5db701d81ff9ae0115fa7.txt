Table 1. Resolved Issues
The following issues that existed in one or more previous versions have been resolved.
DescriptionTracking IDPreviously, if you used the TM Equipment or TM Functional Location data loaders to load data that consisted only of measurements, the Analysis Required check box in the TML Corrosion Analysis datasheet was not selected, and the Calculate button () did not turn orange. If you tried to calculate the analysis, the newly loaded measurements were not included in the calculation. This issue has been resolved. Now, when you load measurements, the Analysis Required check box is selected, and the Calculate button () turns orange, indicating the analysis is ready to be calculated. When you calculate the analysis, the newly loaded measurements are included in the calculation. Also, the affected assets are available in the Assets Requiring a Calculation section of the Thickness Monitoring Overview page, ready for bulk calculation.DE106600
