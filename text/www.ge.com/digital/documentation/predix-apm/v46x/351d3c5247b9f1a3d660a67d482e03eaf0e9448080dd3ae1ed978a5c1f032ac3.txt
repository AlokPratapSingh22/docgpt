TM Data LoadersAbout the Thickness Monitoring (TM) Data LoadersThe following Data Loaders are available in Thickness Monitoring:Thickness Monitoring (TM) Equipment Data LoaderThickness Monitoring (TM) Functional Location Data LoaderThroughout the documentation, these Data Loaders are collectively called the Thickness Monitoring (TM) Data Loaders. You can use them to implement Thickness Monitoring when you have thickness measurement data in a legacy system. To import data using these Data Loaders, GE Digital APM provides the following Excel templates:Thickness Monitoring (TM) Equipment.xlsxThickness Monitoring (TM) Functional Location.xlsx These templates support baseline Thickness Monitoring in GE Digital APM. You must export measurement data from your legacy system so that the data can be used to populate the templates. The data from the templates will then be imported into GE Digital APM using the corresponding Data Loaders. Note:  The Excel templates are referred to throughout this documentation as the data loader workbooks. The data loader workbooks allow you to: Create or update Corrosion Analysis Settings (CAS) records for an Asset (i.e., Equipment or Functional Location), TML Group, or TML.Create or update TML Group records, and link each of them to an Asset.Create or update TML records, and link each of them to an Asset or TML Group.Create or update Thickness Measurement records, and link them to a TML.About the Thickness Monitoring (TM) Data Loaders RequirementsBefore you use the data loader workbooks, you must complete the following steps:Ensure that the Thickness Monitoring module is deployed.Ensure that the following licenses are active:APM Connect PlusThickness Monitoring

Ensure that the following data is present:Site ReferenceEquipment TaxonomyEquipment and Functional Location FamiliesUnits of Measure Conversion Sets
Stress Tables (GE Digital APM provides Stress Tables for Piping, Pressure Vessels, and Tanks. If you want to use values from these Stress Tables with the data loader workbook, you must ensure that the records are imported into your database prior to performing the data load).


Ensure that you have set up appropriate relationships and key fields. To do so, you must login as a member of the MI Thickness Monitoring Administrator Security Group.
Create a relationship between TML Groups and Assets. To do so, configure family preferences, specifying the following values:
Asset-to-Subcomponent Relationship: Has TML GroupSubcomponent-to-Asset Relationship: Has TML GroupComponent ID Field: TML Group ID
Note:  By default, the relationship is created between Equipment and TML Groups. If you want to use the Thickness Monitoring (TM) Functional Location Data Loader, in the drop-down list box at the top of the workspace, select Functional Location.

The Security User loading the data must be associated with either the MI Data Loader User or MI Data Loader Admin Security Role, and must also be associated with the MI Thickness Monitoring Administrator or the MI Thickness Monitoring Inspector Security Group or a Security Role that is associated with at least one of these Security Groups.
The data loader workbooks contain sample data in each column. It is only for your reference. You must remove this data before using the data loader workbooks.About the Thickness Monitoring (TM) Data Loaders Data Model
The Thickness Monitoring (TM) Data Loaders do not load the entire data model illustrated in the normal help documentation. The following data model illustrates which records the Data Loaders support. Assets (Equipment or Functional Location records), illustrated in green, must exist prior to importing data.

About the Thickness Monitoring (TM) Data Loaders General Loading StrategyThis topic describes the best practices to loading the data and the order in which the data will be loaded.Best Practices
For Oracle databases, valid cell values are case-sensitive.The imported data must load in a specific sequence in order to successfully populate fields, to create records, and to link them to the predecessor and successor records. If a data loader worksheet contains any blank cells:When you create new records, the fields corresponding to the blank cells are updated with the default values, if any.When you update existing records, the fields corresponding to the blank cells are not updated.The Thickness Monitoring (TM) Data Loaders map the datasheet columns in the data loader workbooks to fields in GE Digital APM families by their position. Therefore, you must not change the column positions and IDs. You can, however, change the captions if needed. ID fields must not include special characters or spaces.Columns (including columns representing custom fields) in the worksheets should be formatted as Text.You must consider the rules described in the Workbook Layout and Use section of this document while using the data loader workbooks.Details related to an Equipment that is linked to a TML Group or a TML must always be entered on the assets and Asset_CAS worksheets of the Thickness Monitoring (TM) Equipment Data Loader even if the asset has already been loaded earlier. Similarly, details related to a Functional Location that is linked to a TML Group or a TML must always be entered on the Functional_Location and Functional_Location_CAS worksheets of the Thickness Monitoring (TM) Functional Location Data Loader even if the Functional Location has already been loaded earlier.
In addition to the fields included in the data loader workbooks, if you want to add values for more fields for a record, you can add columns for those fields on the appropriate worksheet. 
Note:  The fields that you want to add to the data loader workbooks must already exist in the corresponding family. If not, you must add the fields to the family via Configuration Manager. 
Do not delete a worksheet in the data loader workbooks. 
Load Sequence
The data must be loaded in the following sequence to successfully populate fields, create records, and link them to the predecessor and successor records:
The Assets or the Functional_Location worksheet is processed. If you are using the Thickness Monitoring (TM) Equipment Data Loader, it searches for the Equipment that corresponds to the Equipment ID, CMMS System, and Equipment Technical Number information that you provide on the Assets worksheet. If you are using the Thickness Monitoring (TM) Functional Location Data Loader, it searches for the Functional Location that corresponds to the Functional Location ID and CMMS System information that you provide on the Functional_Location worksheet. If an asset specified on the worksheet does not exist, it will not be loaded. In addition, the TML Groups and TMLs linked to the asset are not loaded. The Asset_CAS or the Functional_Location_CAS worksheet is processed. If you have entered values in all the mandatory cells and if the details of an asset on this worksheet match the details on the Assets or the Functional_Location worksheet:A Corrosion Analysis Settings record is created and linked to the asset using the Has Corrosion Analysis Settings relationship.An Asset Corrosion Analysis record is created and linked to the asset using the Has Corrosion Analyses relationship.If you do not enter values (in cells other than the mandatory ones) on this worksheet, the default values are used. The TML_Group worksheet is processed. For each TML Group, if the details of the asset on the TML_Group worksheet match the details on the assets or the Functional_Location worksheet, a TML Group record is created and linked to the asset using the Has TML Group relationship.The TML_Group_CAS worksheet is processed. For each TML Group:A Corrosion Analysis Settings record is created, and linked to the TML Group using the Has Corrosion Analysis Settings relationship. The fields in the Corrosion Analysis Settings record are populated with the corresponding values on the Asset_CAS or the Functional_Location_CAS worksheet.If you have entered values on the TML_Group_CAS worksheet, the values in the fields in the Corrosion Analysis Settings record linked to the TML Group are replaced with the values on the TML_Group_CAS worksheet.An Asset Corrosion Analysis record is created, and linked to the TML Group using the Has Corrosion Analyses relationship.
The TML worksheet is processed. If you have entered a value in the TML Group ID column on this worksheet, a Thickness Measurement Location is created and linked to the TML Group using the Has DataPoints relationship. Otherwise, the TML is linked to the asset that you have specified on this worksheet. 
The TML_CAS worksheet is processed. For each TML:A Corrosion Analysis Settings record is created, and linked to the TML using the Has Corrosion Analysis Settings relationship. The fields in the Corrosion Analysis Settings record are populated with the corresponding values on the TML_Group_CAS, Asset_CAS, or Functional_Location_CAS worksheet, depending on whether the TML is linked to a TML Group, Equipment, or Functional Location respectively.A TML Corrosion Analysis record is created, and linked to the TML using the Has Corrosion Analyses relationship.If you have entered values on this worksheet, the values in the fields in the Corrosion Analysis Settings record linked to the TML are replaced with the values on the TML_CAS worksheet.The Measurements worksheet is processed. For each row on this worksheet, a Thickness Measurement record is created (or updated), and linked to the TML using the Has Measurements relationship.Note:  For a given TML, if two or more rows contain the same value in the Measurement Date field, then only one Measurement record is created. The fields in that record are populated with values in the last row among them.
After you load the data, the updated assets appear in the Assets and Assets Requiring a Calculation sections on the Thickness Monitoring Overview page. You must calculate all the analyses that you have loaded because they are not calculated automatically after you load the data. 
Note: The data loaders used in TM split large amount of data into the following transaction scopes:Asset Level DataTML Groups in 100-count batchesThickness Measurement Locations in 100-count batchesMeasurements in 250-count batchesIf an error occurs while loading data, you can reduce the transaction scopes as per your requirement. For information on modifying the transaction scopes, refer to the Configure Data Loader Transaction Scopes topic.
About the Thickness Monitoring (TM) Data Loaders Workbook Layout and UseColor Coding
Certain columns on the worksheets have different functions and requirements. To illustrate this, certain columns are color-coded. The following table lists the colors and what they represent.

Color

Description

Comments

Grey 

Lookup Fields

Indicates columns that contain values that are used by the Thickness Monitoring Data Loader to look up and create records. If these columns are removed from the worksheets, the data load will fail. While the worksheets require that these columns be present, values are not necessarily required in these columns.

 Red

 Fields Required for Calculation 

Indicates columns that contain values that are required to perform calculations in Risk Based Inspection. Some cells only require values in certain cases. Such cases are found in parentheses in the first row of each worksheet.

Blue 

 Recommended Fields 

Indicates columns that, according to GE Digital APM Best Practice for Risk Based Inspection, should contain values.

Green 

Custom Fields

Indicates columns where you can specify custom fields.

Limitations
The Thickness Monitoring (TM) Data Loaders have the following limitations:
If you modify the format of the values in columns on any of the worksheets, you will not be able to import data.You cannot create or update nominal measurements using the data loader workbooks. You can only create or update actual measurements.The values that you enter in the data loader workbooks are case-sensitive.You cannot link an RBI Component to a TML Group using the data loader workbooks.You cannot relocate, renew, or organize TMLs using the data loader workbooks.You cannot skip measurements using the data loader workbooks.
If you reimport data, the records that have been created by the Thickness Monitoring (TM) Data Loaders will be updated. Therefore, while reimporting data related to a record, if you remove the data for a field in the data loader workbooks, the value for the corresponding field in GE Digital APM will be either a default value or blank. 
Tip:  If you do not want to update a field value, you can remove the corresponding column from the data loader workbooks. You cannot, however, remove columns that correspond to required fields.

Assets Worksheet
On the Assets worksheet, you will specify Equipment to which you want to link Thickness Measurement Locations (TMLs) and TML Groups. This worksheet is included only in the Thickness Monitoring (TM) Equipment Data Loader. The columns that appear on this worksheet also appear on every subsequent worksheet in the Thickness Monitoring (TM) Equipment Data Loader. They are used to identify the records that will be linked, directly or indirectly, to the Equipment. The combination of values in the three columns on this worksheet must be unique.
