In case, if you have created an attribute with an incorrect datatype, and you want to change it, the only option is to delete the attribute and recreate it.About This TaskBased on the following scenarios, you can delete the attribute and create a new attribute with the correct datatype:If you have created a classification and added an attribute to the classification. You have also created instances based on the classification. By default, all the classification attributes are inherited to all the instances. Now, if you realized that the classification attribute datatype is incorrect and you want to modify the datatype of the attribute. In this case, you must first delete all the instances, and then delete the attribute from the classification and recreate a new attribute with the desired datatype.If you have created a classification and added an attribute to the classification. You have also created instances based on the classification. The classification attributes are inherited to all the instance. Now, you have added a new attribute to the classification and did not create any new instance after that. At this stage, if you realized that the attribute datatype is incorrect, you can delete the attribute directly from the classification and recreate it with the desired datatype. In this case, you need not delete the instances, because the new attribute was defined after the instances were created.ProcedureTo modify a value in custom attributes for a classification:In the module navigation menu, go to
Assets >  Classifications.Find and select a classification in the Classification results table.In the Custom Attributes section on the classification view, hover over and select an attribute value.Enter a new value in the Value box, then press ENTER or select outside the box.The new value is confirmed with a message.Alternatively, you can hover over a reserved attribute value, select , and then enter a value in the Attribute Value Definition box.Note: You cannot change the datatype of the attribute.Select Save.The entered value is saved and appears in the Value column for the selected reserved attribute.Delete a Custom Attribute from a ClassificationYou can delete a custom attribute for a selected classification. However, if an attribute is defined in the root-classification, and has been inherited to the child-classification, you cannot delete the attribute from the child-classification. When you delete a classification attribute which has instances, the attribute is soft deleted, which means the attribute will not be seen either in the classification nor on the instances, but still exists in the database. In that case, you will not be able to create another attribute with the same name and different datatype. You must either create an attribute with a different name or recreate an attribute with the same name and datatype as that of the deleted classification attribute.About This Task
