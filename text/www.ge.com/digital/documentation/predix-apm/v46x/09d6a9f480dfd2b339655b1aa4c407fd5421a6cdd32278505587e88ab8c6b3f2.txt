Groups Overview







Groups OverviewAbout GroupsGroups are a collection of assets or tags of the same type.Groups are logical structures that hold instances of the same object type, and are associated to parent nodes in the business functional hierarchy.For example, a group of asset instances cannot contain any tag instances. The group of asset instances can be associated with a segment. site, or asset instance node that is higher in the business functional hierarchy.You can add Groups for classifications and add custom attributes for the group.You can use Groups to locate assets or tags by the type of data provided. For instance, you can access a group of tags by function.You can add, search and access groups by:All GroupsTag Classification GroupsAsset Classification GroupsBusiness Functional Hierarchy GroupsGE Digital APM Groups allows you to add, search, select and configure a specific group.The Groups table lists the first 250 groups.
