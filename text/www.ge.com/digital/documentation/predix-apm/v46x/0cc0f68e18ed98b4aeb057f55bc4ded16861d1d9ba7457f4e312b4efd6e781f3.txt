Overview







OverviewOverview of the Graphs ModuleGraphs provide a visual representation of data, and are used throughout GE Digital APM. Graphs can be created and modified on the Graph page, but are used throughout GE Digital APM.Each graph can be created based on a query or dataset. When you create a graph, you will select the type of graph that you want to build and the information that you want to display. At least one field in any graph must be numeric.Any values that you want to see in a graph must be returned by the query or included in the dataset on which the graph is based. Any changes that you make to the underlying data will be reflected in the graph. For example, if you build a graph based on a query that returns the repair costs for each pump in your system, and then create a new Pump record, the next time you view the graph, the data for the additional Pump will appear.Note:  If you remove information from the underlying query or dataset a field that is included in the graph (e.g., you remove the field on which the x-axis is based), the next time that you try to open the graph, an error message will appear, indicating that the information is not valid.After you create a graph, it appears in the Graph Result workspace. You can view and modify areas on the chart by accessing the Settings pane.Access the Graphs PageProcedureIn the module navigation menu, select
