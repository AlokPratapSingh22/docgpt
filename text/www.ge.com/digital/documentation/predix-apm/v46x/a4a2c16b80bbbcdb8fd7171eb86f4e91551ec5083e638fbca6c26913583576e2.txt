Family Field DescriptionsCriticality Calculator RBI Components RecordsCriticality Calculator RBI Components
Criticality Calculator RBI Component records store information about the component on which you will perform an RBI 581 Risk Analysis.
 This topic provides an alphabetical list and description of the fields that exist for the Criticality Calculator RBI Components family. The information in the table reflects the baseline state and behavior of these fields. If the component type is Exchanger Bundle, then, for each field on the RBI Component, there are two fields on the datasheet - one for the channel, and the other for the shell.
The following families are enabled for site filtering, which means that the records in these families can be assigned to a specific site, and will then only be accessible to users who are assigned to the same site and have the appropriate license and family privileges. See the Site Filtering section of the documentation for more information on using this feature.
