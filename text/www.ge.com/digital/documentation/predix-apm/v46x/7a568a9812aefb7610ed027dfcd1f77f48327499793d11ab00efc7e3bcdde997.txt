Table 2. Known Issues
The following issues are unresolved in this release.
DescriptionTracking IDWhen you have multiple y-axes enabled on a Time-Series chart, Y zoom and XY zoom provide an inconsistent user experience because all the axes do not scale correctly to reflect the zoomed-in state.DE104375If you point to a diagnostic marker on a SmartSignal chart, no information appears. To exit the mode and view the information about the marker, refresh the charts.DE101633If you enable the cross-hair mode in an analysis and then add new charts to the template, the cross-hair information is not reflected on the new charts, and the cross-hair markers are no longer visible on the existing charts. To prevent this, disable cross-hair mode, add the charts, and then enable the cross-hair mode again.DE99126When you delete tags on a Time-Series chart after you have plotted pin markers, the deleted tags appear in the marker data table. To prevent this issue, delete the tags, and then set the pins on the charts.DE95436While modifying the Time-Series chart in multiple y-axes mode, if you select Apply, your changes are neither applied nor visible in the chart settings. To prevent this issue, select Cancel, and then create the template for an ad hoc view. Alternatively, you can save the template, and then modify the existing template as needed.DE93811You must use Google Chrome to add multiple charts to a SmartSignal card.
