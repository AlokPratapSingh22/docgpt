Tag BrowserAbout the Tag BrowserThe Tag Browser allows you to find tags, view tag information, and plot tags.The Tag Browser loads the in-context asset and its associated tags by default. You can add additional assets and their associated tags to the Tag Browser.You can plot SmartSignal Model groups and tags from the Tag Browser.The following appears in the Tag Browser:The asset currently in context.The asset attributes associated with the selected asset. Listed asset attributes are restricted to Reference attributes only.The tag expressions associated with the selected asset.The plotted tags for the selected view.The tag groups associated with the asset.The tag groups that have been deployed. The SmartSignal analytics provide Modes and Models for both active and inactive tags.The non-SmartSignal analytics provide Input Tags and Output Tags. When you hover over the Analytic name, the Analytic deployment name appears. You cannot add additional assets for Event Data Analysis charts in the Tag Browser, Tag Expressions, or Search Browser panes.The Tag Browser and Plotted Tags appear in the Tag Panel for both SmartSignal and Analysis cards. The Asset node in the Tag Browser expands to display the All Tags node, the Analytics node, and the Tag Expressions node. Child-Asset nodes are expandable. The Tag Expressions node can be expanded to reveal the relevant tag expressions for the asset context. To view the tag details in a tool tip, hover over a tag in the Tag Browser or in Plotted Tags. The Analytics node expands to display model groups, which also expand to display groups of tags that can be plotted. Tool tips are not available for nodes.When you use search in the Tag Browser, tags within the selected assets are highlighted as you enter characters.When you select a view, any tags that are currently plotted in the view appear in Plotted Tags.Use the Tag Browser to:Plot tags, analytics groups and tags, and tag expressions to the charts for the selected view.Globally mute or unmute tags that appear on the charts for the selected view.Access tag information.Add and remove multiple assets and their associated tags.Search the Tag Browser by tag name or description.View tag groups associated with the asset in the tag tree. Note: The Analytic tag groups appear in the order of their ordinal numbers in the Analytic Groups section of the Tag Browser, when the tag groups are assigned ordinal numbers in the Analytics template. However, if the Analytic tag groups do not have any ordinal numbers assigned in the Analytics template they appear in the alphabetical order in the Tag Browser.In Analysis charts, you can drag up to 40 tags to a Time Series, Spiderweb, or Parallel Axis chart in the view singly or in groups. The X-Y and Polar charts are limited to two or three tags per chart, respectively. Double-clicking the heading of Plotted Tags collapses it. You may need to scroll to see all items in a long list of tags in the Tag Browser.In SmartSignal charts, you can drag up to 40 tags to a Time Series chart in the view singly or in groups. If you add a group with more than 40 tags, the remaining tags are added to a new card automatically.Removing an asset from the tree does not affect tags already plotted; however, tag expressions listed in the tree may become invalid. The primary asset cannot be removed. Nodes and tags listed in the Tag Browser appear as specific icons depending on the type of tag:Tag iconMeaning
Card icon: Name of cards in the Plotted Tags list for the view.

Chart icon: Name of charts on the associated card in the Plotted Tags list for the view. Charts appear under a card in the Plotted Tags list.

Tag with data: Includes tags that are associated with the selected asset during ingestion. 
Asset attribute tag: Includes tags that are related to the selected asset, such as wind speed or power output of the asset. No data: Indicates that no data is available. GE Digital APM allows tags with no data for a specified time range to be plotted to a chart. The tag appears in the Plotted Tags list, but is disabled. When the date range is changed to include tag data, it appears as enabled and plots its data.Computed tag: Indicates a tag created using the Expression Calculator. These tags are simple math calculations that include tags related to the selected asset. If an asset is removed from the Tag Tree Panel, computed tags related to the removed asset can become invalid for plotting.
Tag group: Indicates a group of designated related tags created during ingestion of the selected asset that can be plotted simultaneously.
Threshold tag: Indicates a static value created as a marker to measure against the performance of other tags plotted on the chart.Reference curve tag: Indicates a power curve tag created to assess performance for tags used in an X-Y chart.
Analytics tag: Includes SmartSignal tags that are associated with the selected asset during ingestion.Tag groups associated: Indicates the tag groups associated with the asset. Tag not configured: Indicates that the tag was removed from the selected asset, or that you do not have access to the asset associated with the tag.Tag filtered: Indicates that the tag has filters applied.Unit of measure: The gear icon is used to select line style, line color, and unit of measure for tags and charts that do not use pairs of tags. They are used to set unit of measure for charts that use pairs of tags.
Plot Tags for Time Series Analysis ChartsTags and child tags can be plotted on an Alert Analysis or Time Series Analysis chart. About This Task
The default ad hoc analysis chart has no tags plotted, so you must search for tags and plot them manually. Analysis charts may utilize pre-defined analysis templates, which can be accessed in the View Selector. Alert analysis charts contain pre-plotted tags that depend on the analysis template, which is part of the alert template associated with the alert. You can modify the charts by dragging and dropping additional tags on a chart. 
When plotting a tag, the source UoM is converted to the standard UoM during plotting.
Each plotted tag has a unique color identifier, and the data for that tag is plotted on the chart using the same color. Plotted tags with no data or tags that are not configured have no color assigned.
You can plot tags to charts in the following ways:On the asset tags list, plotted tag list, or search results list to an existing chart.On the asset tags list, plotted tag list, or search results list to a new chart.You can select multiple tags from the asset tags list, plotted tag list, or search results by using the Shift key or the Control key on the keyboard. Note: This is limited to 40 tags.
The Tag Browser section of the Tag Tree Browser is made up of parent nodes, such as assets or tag expressions. These parent nodes expand to reveal tags. The Plotted Tag section is made up of tags. In some cases, a tag node can be expanded to reveal child tags, which can also be plotted to charts.
