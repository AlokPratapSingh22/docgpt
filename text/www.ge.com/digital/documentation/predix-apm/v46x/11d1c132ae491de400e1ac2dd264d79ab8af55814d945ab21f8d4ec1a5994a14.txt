Calculating Inventory Component Mass
The inventory component mass of a component is calculated using the values in the following fields in the Criticality Calculator RBI Component record:
Operating Pressure (P)Operating Temperature (T)Diameter (d)Length (L) Note: If the component type is Piping, then the value in the Piping Length field is used instead of the value in the Length field.
Percent Liquid Volume (pc)Molwt (This value is stored in the RepresentativeFluids reference table for the fluid specified in the Process Fluid field in the Criticality Calculator RBI Components record) Fluid Density (This value is specified in the RepresentativeFluids reference table for the fluid specified in the Process Fluid field in the Criticality Calculator RBI Components record)
Note: If the component is linked to an RBI 581 Risk Analysis, then these values are taken from the corresponding fields in the analysis record instead of the component record.
 The inventory component mass of a component is calculated as follows:
 Inventory Component Mass = (Liquid Volume x Fluid Density) + (Vapor Volume x Vapor Density)
Where:
Liquid Volume = (pc/100) x Volume of the cylinder Note: The volume of the cylinder is calculated from the values in the Diameter and Length fields in the Criticality Calculator RBI Component record.
Vapor Volume = (1-(pc/100)) x Volume of the cylinderVapor Density = (Molwt x (P + 14.7)) / (10.73 x (T + 459.15) x z)
This value is populated in the Inventory Component Mass field in the Common section of the associated RBI 581 Consequence Evaluation.
Example for Calculating Inventory Component Mass
Suppose a component has the following specifications:

Component Type: Heat Exchanger (Shell)

Process Fluid : C6-C8

Operating Pressure: 101 Pounds/Sq Inch Gage

Operating Temperature: 121 Degrees Fahrenheit

Molwt of CO: 28

Diameter: 97.625 inches

Length: 360 inches

Percent Liquid Volume: 50 percent

Fluid Density: 42.704

Given these values:

Volume of the cylinder = (pi x (d/12) x (d/12) x (L/12)) / 4
Volume of the cylinder = ((22/7) x (97.625/12) x (97.625/12) x (360/12)) / 4
Volume of the cylinder = 1560.075 Cubic feet

Liquid volume = (pc/100) x Volume of the cylinder
Liquid volume = (50/100) x 1560.075
Liquid volume = 780.038 Cubic feet

Vapor volume = (1 - (pc/100)) x volume of the cylinder
Vapor volume = (1 - (50/100)) x 1560.075
Vapor volume = 780.038  Cubic feet

Vapor Density = (Molwt x (P + 14.7)) / (10.73 x (T + 459.15) x z)
Vapor Density = (100 x (101 + 14.7)) / (10.73 x (121 + 459.15) x 1)
Vapor Density = 1.859 Pounds per cubic feet

Inventory Component Mass = (Liquid Volume x Fluid Density) + (Vapor Volume x Vapor Density)
Inventory Component Mass = (780.038 x 42.704) + (780.038 x 1.859)
Inventory Component Mass = 34760.526 Pounds
Note: The value in the Inventory Component Mass field on the RBI Component datasheet may slightly differ from the value that is shown in the example. This happens because of rounding off some of the values.

Calculating Inventory Group Mass
The inventory group mass is calculated as the sum of the inventory component mass values of all the individual components in an inventory group. This value is populated in the Inventory Group Mass field in the Common section in the associated RBI 581 Consequence Evaluation record. If the component is not linked to an inventory group, then the value in the Inventory Group Mass field is the same as the value in the Inventory Component Mass field.
Note: The value in the Calculated Inventory field in a component datasheet is calculated only for RBI 580. It is not used in calculating inventory group mass.
For example, suppose you have created an inventory group, Group 1, and linked it to three components, Component 1, Component 2, and Component 3. The inventory component mass values for each of these components are shown in parentheses.



In this case, the inventory group mass is calculated as follows:
Inventory Group Mass of Group 1 = Inventory Component Mass of Component 1 + Inventory Component Mass of Component 2 + inventory Component Mass of Component 3
Inventory Group Mass of Group 1 = 120 + 100 + 130
Inventory Group Mass of Group 1 = 350 Pounds
Suppose you have created an RBI 581 Risk Analysis, Analysis 1, for Component 1. GE Digital APM then calculates the inventory component mass of Component 1 based on the input values in Analysis 1. In the following diagram, this value is shown in parentheses next to Analysis1.



In this case, the inventory group mass is calculated as follows:
Inventory Group Mass of Group 1 = Inventory Component Mass calculated based on input values from Analysis 1 + Inventory Component Mass of Component 2 + Inventory Component Mass of Component 3
Inventory Group Mass of Group 1 = 150 + 100 + 130
Inventory Group Mass of Group 1 = 380 Pounds
