Second Quarter of 2022Release Date: June 24, 2022June 24, 2022This topic provides a list of product changes released for this module on this date.
Table 1. Resolved Issues
The following issues, which existed in one or more previous versions, have been resolved.
DescriptionTracking IDPreviously, in System Reliability, when scenarios with very short action intervals are run in Monte Carlo simulation, the simulation will take a long time to complete. This issue has been resolved. Now, if you attempt to create an action interval of one hour or less, a message will appear stating that simulations with action intervals of less than one hour are not permitted.DE180465Previously, when running Monte Carlo simulations, it was possible for a simulation to run indefinitely without completing. This restricted the server space for other users and for other queued simulations. This issue has been resolved. Now, a configurable limit of four hours has been set for a simulation run; once this limit is reached, the simulation run will be terminated.DE180463
