Data LoaderAbout the Root Cause Analysis (RCA) Data LoaderThe Root Cause Analysis (RCA) Data Loader allows both primary and third-party content to be delivered to GE Digital APM through either the RCA Data Model. The imported data can then be used to maintain relationships between the RCA data and the Failure Modes and Hypotheses. Users can deploy the data loader to import:Legacy analysis data for performance comparisons.Third-party template content.The Root Cause Analysis (RCA) Data Loader transfers data from a fixed-format Excel workbook into either the RCA Data Model or the RCA Logic Tree. The imported data can be:An RCA Analysis.An RCA Event.A Failure Mode.A Logic Gate.An RCA Hypothesis.An RCA Diagram Relationship.Note:  The Root Cause Analysis (RCA) Data Loader will not be backwards compatible to earlier versions of GE Digital APM.About the Root Cause Analysis (RCA) Data Loader RequirementsTo use the Root Cause Analysis (RCA) Data Loader, your organization must have completed the deployment of the Root Cause Analysis module.Security Settings
The Security User performing the data load operation must be associated with either the MI Data Loader User or MI Data Loader Admin Security Role, and must also be associated with the MI PROACT Administrator Security Group or a Security Role that is associated with this Security Group.

About the Root Cause Analysis (RCA) Data Loader General Loading StrategyBest Practices
When importing data using the Root Cause Analysis (RCA) Data Loader, you must use the following best practices:
ID fields (row 2 of each worksheet) must not include special characters or spaces.Columns in the worksheets should be formatted as either text or dates.The first two rows of each worksheet should not be edited.Only import a maximum of 500 analyses in each data load.
Limitations
This section documents a list of the limitations for the Root Cause Analysis (RCA) Data Loader:
The user must use the Root Cause Analysis (RCA) Data Loader workbook (Root Cause Analysis (RCA).xlsx). Any modifications made by the user to the values in column headings in any of the worksheets will not be imported.Note:  Any column values in a customized format will not be imported by the Root Cause Analysis (RCA) Data Loader.If the user imports the same data multiple times, the most recently imported data is included in the database. If a record currently resides in the database and is then reimported, the newly imported file will replace the existing file in the database. The Root Cause Analysis (RCA) Data Loader does not append the existing record.
Load Sequence
Create an RCA Analysis.Create an RCA Event.Link the RCA Event to the RCA Analysis through the RCA Analysis Relationship.Create and link one or more Failure Modes to the RCA Event through the RCA Analysis Relationship.Create and link one or more Logic Gates to a specific Failure Mode through the Has Analysis Relationship, where the Failure Mode is the predecessor of the Logic Gate.Create and link one or more Hypotheses to a specific Logic Gate, through the Has Analysis Relationship, where the Hypothesis is the successor of the Logic Gate.
About the RCA Template Data Loader Workbook Layout and Use
In order to import data using the Root Cause Analysis (RCA) Data Loader, GE Digital provides an Excel workbook (Root Cause Analysis (RCA).xlsx) that supports baseline Root Cause Analysis in GE Digital APM. This template must be used to perform the data load. Using custom changes in code and in design, you can modify the Excel template to include custom fields used by your organization.
The following table lists the worksheets that are included in the Root Cause Analysis (RCA).xlsx workbook:WorksheetDescriptionRCA_Analysis_TemplateThis worksheet is used to define Analysis records.RCA_EventThis worksheet is used to define Event records.RCA_Failure_ModeThis worksheet is used to specify Failure Mode details.RCA_Logic_GateThis worksheet is used to specify Logic Gate details.RCA_HypothesisThis worksheet is used to specify Hypothesis details.RCA_Diagram_RelationshipThis worksheet is used to specify Diagram Relationship details.
Example: RCA Diagram Relationship
The following Logic Tree diagram depicts an RCA Diagram Relationship for a Pump Failure. The Logic Tree displays two distinct parent nodes and their subsequent child nodes:



Using the Logic Tree diagram, you can parse the parent/child relationships into the RCA_Diagram_Relationship worksheet provided by the Root Cause Analysis (RCA) Data Loader workbook. Once the workbook is complete, the Root Cause Analysis (RCA) Data Loader can be employed.
