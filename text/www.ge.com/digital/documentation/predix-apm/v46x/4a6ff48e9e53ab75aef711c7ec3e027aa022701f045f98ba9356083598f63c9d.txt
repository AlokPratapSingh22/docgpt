About Color-Coding
Color-coding lets you see at a glance whether certain conditions exist for a given Thickness Measurement Location (TML) or Thickness Measurement. A color-coding category is assigned to each TML or Thickness Measurement based on the following criteria:
CategoryVisual CueCriteria for a TMLCriteria for a Thickness MeasurementBelow T-Min



The value in the Measurement Value field in the latest Thickness Measurement is less than the value in the Minimum Thickness field.The value in the Measurement Value field is less than the value in the Minimum Thickness field in the associated TML.Overdue

The value in the Scheduled Next Inspection Date or the Projected T-min Date field is earlier than the current date.N/AHigh Loss


The decrease in the measurement value of the latest Thickness Measurement compared to that of the previous one is greater than or equal to a specified percentage. 
Note: The default value is 30 percent. You can, however, modify this value.

The decrease in the measurement value of the latest Thickness Measurement compared to that of the previous one is greater than or equal to a specified percentage.
Note: The default value is 30 percent. You can, however, modify this value.
Growth

The measurement value of the latest Thickness Measurement is greater than that of the previous one.The measurement value of the latest Thickness Measurement is greater than that of the previous one.Normal

The TML does not meet the criteria for any of the aforementioned categories.The Thickness Measurement does not meet the criteria for any of the aforementioned categories.
Note: The values displayed in the Measurements section are rounded up to four decimal places. When assigning a color-coding category, instead of these rounded up values, the actual field values are considered.
These categories appear at the top of the TMLs section in the Analysis Overview workspace. The number in parentheses next to each category indicates the number of records that meet the criteria for each category. The visual cue appears in each row in the list of TMLs and Thickness Measurements.
Tip: You can filter the TMLs for each category by selecting the category at the top of the section. You can remove the filter by selecting the same category again.
Even if a TML or a Thickness Measurement meets the criteria for more than one category, only one color-code is assigned to each record, based on the following priority:
Below T-MinOverdueHigh LossGrowth
Example: Color-Coding

Suppose a TML contains the following field values:

Minimum Thickness: 1.2 inches
High Loss: 10 percent (as specified on the TM Admin Preferences page)
Suppose the TML contains the following Thickness Measurements.

Measurement IDMeasurement Value (inches)TM-1 1.34TM-2 1.20

The following table describes the color-coding category that will be applied to each Thickness Measurement.

Measurement IDColor-Coding CategoryReasonTM-1Normal
The Measurement Value does not meet the criteria for any other categories.
TM-2High Loss
The percentage of decrease between the latest Measurement Value (1.20 inches) and the previous one (1.34 inches) is greater than 10 percent.


Suppose you have created two more Thickness Measurements with the following Measurement Values:

Measurement IDMeasurement Value (inches)TM-3 1.01TM-41.21

The following table describes the color-coding category that will be applied to each Thickness Measurement.

Measurement IDColor-Coding CategoryReasonTM-1Normal
The Measurement Value does not meet the criteria for any other categories.
TM-2Normal
Although the percentage of decrease in the Measurement Value (1.20 inches) from the previous one (1.34 inches) is greater than 10 percent, since this is no longer the latest Thickness Measurement, the category Normal is applied instead of High Loss.
TM-3Below T-MinThe Measurement Value (1.01 inches) is less than Minimum Thickness (1.2 inches).TM-4GrowthThe Measurement Value (1.21 inches) is greater than the previous one (1.01 inches).

Suppose the current date is December 31, 2017, and the TML Corrosion Analysis associated with the TML contains the following field values:

Scheduled Next Inspection Date: January 01, 2018
Projected T-min Date: January 02, 2018
For the TML, color-coding category is applied based on the following logic:

Below T-Min: The value in the Measurement Value field (1.21 inches) of the latest Thickness Measurement (TM-4) is greater than the value in the Minimum Thickness field (1.2 inches). Therefore, the category Below T-Min is not applied to the TML.
Overdue: The Scheduled Next Inspection Date (January 01, 2018) and the Projected T-Min Date (January 02, 2018) are later than the current date ( December 31, 2017). Therefore, the category Overdue is not applied to the TML.
High Loss: There is no decrease in the Measurement Value of the latest Thickness Measurement (1.21 inches) compared to that of the previous one (1.01 inches). Therefore, the category High Loss is not applied to the TML.
Growth: The Measurement Value of the latest Thickness Measurement (1.21 inches) is greater than that of the previous one (1.01 inches). Therefore, the category Growth is applied to the TML.

About the Measurement Data Entry (MDE) Workspace
The Measurement Data Entry workspace is used for entering Thickness Measurement readings for multiple TMLs. It is divided into two areas: the common measurement data section, and the data entry grid.
Common Measurement Data


The common measurement data section appears at the top of the Measurement Data Entry workspace, and allows you to define values that will be distributed to cells in the corresponding columns for each Thickness Measurement Location (TML) listed in the data entry grid.
The Common Measurement Data section provides three boxes in which you can enter data: 

Measurement Taken Date

Measurement Taken By

Temperature

You can customize this section to make additional boxes available. Data entered in these boxes becomes the default value in the corresponding cell in each row. 
Changes to the common measurement data section will not be applied to any rows in the data entry grid that already contain data.

Data Entry Grid


The data entry grid appears below the common measurement data section. The grid will be populated with one row for each TML linked to the record that you selected when accessing the Measurement Data Entry workspace.
By default, the grid is sorted in ascending order according to the value in the TML ID column.
Some TMLs will require you to enter multiple readings, as determined by the value in the Number of Readings field in a TML. You can enter multiple readings on the data entry grid by specifying the values separated by semi-colon or by selecting  in the row corresponding to a TML. A measurement value will be determined based on the readings.

TM Rules Lookup
Thickness Monitoring includes a set of baseline Thickness Monitoring Rules Lookup records and the associated Rules Library projects. You can use the baseline records as they are delivered, or you can modify them to suit your specific needs. Like all reference table records, Thickness Monitoring Rules Lookup records are best viewed through a query. You can manage Thickness Monitoring Rules Lookup records via the TM Admin Preferences page.
Thickness Monitoring Rules

The following table provides a list of the fields that exist in the Thickness Monitoring Rules Lookup family, descriptions of these fields, and information about any corresponding Thickness Measurement Location (TML) fields.

TM Site Filtering
All of the families included in the Thickness Monitoring module employ the GE Digital APM
Site Control. This means that you can access or modify only the records in TM that are assigned to the same site to which you are assigned. 

Tip: For more information, refer to the Site Filtering section of the documentation.

Example: Viewing TMLs

Consider an organization that has three sites, Site X, Site Y, and Site Z.
TML A: Assigned to Site XTML B: Assigned to Site YTML C: Assigned to Site Z
TML D: No site assigned (global record)
Note:  A global record in TM only occurs if there was an error in the data load or if the site location was changed by a Super User. Global records are not recommended Best Practices in TM. 


Scenario 1: User assigned to only Site X

When this user accesses the TMLs from an analysis, he or she will see:
TML ATML D

Scenario 2: User assigned to both Site X and Site Y

When this user accesses the TMLs from an analysis, he or she will see: 
TML ATML BTML D

Scenario 3: Super User

When this user accesses the TMLs from an analysis he or she will see:
TML ATML BTML CTML D
