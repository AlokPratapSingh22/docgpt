                    .
                
These tasks may be completed by multiple people in your organization. We recommend, however, that the tasks be completed in the order in which they are listed.

ProcedureUpgrade to the latest version of GE Digital APM.
This module will be updated to the latest version of GE Digital APM automatically. No additional steps are required.
ASM Security Groups

The following table lists the baseline Security Groups available for users within this module, as well as the baseline Roles to which those Security Groups are assigned. In Predix APM, Roles are assigned to Security Users through permission sets.

Important:  Assigning a Security User to a Role grants that user the privileges associated with all of the Security Groups that are assigned to that Role. To avoid granting a Security User unintended privileges, before assigning a Security User to a Role, be sure to review all of the privileges associated with the Security Groups assigned to that Role.

Associating a Strategy with a Specific Site
Some companies that use the GE Digital software have facilities at multiple sites or locations around the world. Each site contains unique locations and equipment.
If needed, you can define these sites and associate equipment and locations with the site to which they belong. When you create an Asset Strategy record and link it to an Equipment or Functional Location record, the Site Reference field will be populated automatically with the Record ID of the Site Reference record to which the Equipment or Functional Location record is linked. To help streamline the strategy-building process, the GE Digital system will allow you to add multiple Asset Strategies to System Strategies only if all the underlying equipment and locations belong to the same site.
