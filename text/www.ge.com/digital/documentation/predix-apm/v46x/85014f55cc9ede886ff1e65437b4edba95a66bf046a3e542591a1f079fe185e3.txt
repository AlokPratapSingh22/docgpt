RisksAbout RisksIn System Reliability, a Risk identifies one way in which an Asset can fail. If the Risk occurs, then the piece of equipment or location will fail, and the system cannot run. In System Reliability Analyses, Risks are stored in System Risks, which can be linked to System Assets and System Switches.A piece of equipment or location may have multiple Risks to represent multiple ways in which that piece of equipment or location can fail. As such, System Assets and System Switches can be linked to multiple System Risks.Each Risk has a characteristic pattern of causing an Asset to fail as defined by its TTF distribution data or maximum operating time. Risks also have TTR distribution data, which characterizes the time needed to correct the failure that occurs as the result of the Risk and get the system running again. This distribution data is stored in Distributions, which are linked to Risks.About Actions and Risks
After you create an Action in a System Reliability Analysis, you can assign a single Risk or multiple Risks to that Action. When you assign a Risk to an Action, a link is created between a System Risk Assessment record, which stores the GUID of the mitigated Risk in the Risk GUID field, and the Action. This allows the Action to mitigate the Risk. An Action may mitigate a Risk by changing certain properties, such as failure consequences or the failure distribution, of the Risk.
                               Actions mitigate Risks in different ways depending on the type of Action that is assigned to the Risk. The different types of Actions mitigate Risks in the following ways:
                                
Preventive Maintenance Action: Can mitigate the Time to Fail (TTF) distribution of the Risk by increasing the maximum operating time of the Risk, as defined by the fields in the Distribution record that defines the TTF distribution associated with the Risk. For example, the Replace Seal Action in Scenario B of the System Reliability Analysis Example mitigates the Seal Failure Risk by creating more operating time by replacing the existing seals, which have a smaller amount of operating time, with new seals that have a larger amount of operating time.
Condition Monitor or Inspection Action: Can mitigate the consequences of failure by fixing potential failures before they occur. This allows proactive repairs, or planned corrections, to be made to the system instead of fixing a failure using an unplanned correction. Planned corrections can consume less Resources and lower the costs of a Scenario. For example, the Vibration Analysis Action in Scenario B of the System Reliability Analysis Example mitigates the Bearing Failure Risk by identifying a potential Bearing Failure and executing a planned correction, which requires less Resources and less Resource usage than executing an unplanned correction.
Special Action: Can mitigate the failure consequences of the Risk, as defined in the Fixed Unplanned Correction Cost field of the System Risk record, and the TTF distribution, as defined by the Distribution record that represents the TTF distribution associated with the Risk. For example, the occurrence of the Redesign Impeller Action in Scenario B of the System Reliability Analysis Example mitigates the Impeller Failure by reducing the fixed unplanned correction cost and extending the TTF distribution of the Impeller Failure Risk.
Note: An Action does not have to mitigate a Risk, but associating an Action with a Risk and mitigating the Risk creates a more reliable system.

Potential and Functional Risks
After you add elements to a Diagram, you must connect the elements to create the Diagram. Depending on the structure of the system for which you are creating a Diagram, you will want to connect elements to each other in a series or parallel to one another.
Note: Interaction with diagramming and design canvases is not available on touch-screen devices.
Elements Connected in a Series 
When you connect elements to each other in a series, every element has one preceding connection and one succeeding connection, with only one path from the Start element to the End element. For example, in the following image of Scenario A in the System Reliability Analysis example, the elements in the Diagram for Scenario A root subsystem are connected in a series: every element between the Start and End elements has one connection from an element and one connection to an element, and you can reach the End element from the Start element in only one way.



Elements Connected in Parallel 
When you connect elements in parallel to one another, one or more elements will be connected to multiple elements, and there will be multiple paths from the Start element to the End element. For example, in the System Reliability Analysis example, the Bottling Line elements in the Bottling Subsystem root subsystem are connected in parallel. In this case, the Start element and the Linkelement are connected to three Subsystem elements: Bottling Line 1, Bottling Line 2, and Bottling Line 3. Therefore, there are three different paths from the Start element to the End element, depending on which of the three Bottling Lines that you pass through.



Resetting Risks
When a simulation is run, the occurrence of the Risks that are defined for a piece of equipment, location, or switch are simulated, based on the TTF Distribution associated with that Risk. After a Risk occurs or after actions are performed that mitigate the occurrence of that Risk in the simulation, that Risk will be reset automatically. This means that the time in-service for the component associated with the Risk will be changed to zero (0), indicating that the component was replaced (or repaired to as good as new).
Conditions for Resetting a Risk
When a Risk will be reset automatically is determined by the failure type of that Risk. A Risk whose failure type is Failure With Replacement will be reset automatically when any of the following scenarios occur:
An unplanned correction takes place following the occurrence of a Risk.A planned correction takes place to mitigate the occurrence of a Risk.Preventive Maintenance is performed against a piece of equipment to mitigate the occurrence of a Risk.A Special Action with a TTF replacement is performed against a piece of equipment to mitigate the occurrence of a Risk.
A Risk whose failure type is Failure Without Replacement will be reset automatically when any of the following scenarios occurs:
Preventive Maintenance is performed against a piece of equipment to mitigate the occurrence of a Risk.A Special Action with a TTF replacement is performed against a piece of equipment to mitigate the occurrence of a Risk.
Conditions for Resetting a Risk
Suppose that the following Risks with a failure type of Failure With Replacement are defined in your simulation for a Water Pump:
Bearing Failure Impeller Failure Seal Failure 
In the simulation, after unplanned correction is completed following the occurrence of the Bearing Failure Risk , the time in-service for the Bearing will be reset automatically to zero (0) to indicate that you will replace the Bearing after it fails so that the Bearing Failure Risk will not occur again until the defined TTF Distribution is reached.
Specifying Additional Risks
In addition to Risks being reset automatically as described in the preceding scenarios, you can specify that additional Risks be reset following the planned or unplanned correction of a given Risk. In other words, you can specify a Risk as a source Risk, whose planned or unplanned correction triggers additional Risks to be reset at that time. This means that the time in-service for the components associated with the additional Risks will be changed to zero (0), indicating that the additional components were also replaced (or repaired to as good as new) following the planned or unplanned correction of the source Risk.
Throughout the documentation we will use the term source Risk to refer to a Risk whose planned or unplanned correction triggers the resetting of additional Risks. We will use the term additional Risk to refer to Risks that are reset by the planned or unplanned correction of a source Risk.
You can specify that additional Risks should be reset only when:

An unplanned correction takes place following the occurrence of a source Risk.
-or-
A planned correction takes place to mitigate the occurrence of a source Risk.
Source Risks that are mitigated as a result of Special Action with a TTF replacement or Preventive Maintenance will not trigger any additional Risks to be reset.
Specifying Additional Risks
Suppose that:

 You will replace the Seal, in addition to the Bearing, when the Bearing Failure Risk occurs.
-or-
The planned correction that you perform to mitigate the occurrence of the Bearing Failure Risk will also mitigate the occurrence of the Seal Failure Risk.
In this case, you want to indicate in your simulation that the Bearing Failure Risk (i.e., the source Risk) should reset the Seal Failure Risk (i.e., the additional Risk). In other words, the time that the Seal has been in-service will also be changed to zero (0) to reflect that the Seal will be replaced (or repaired to as good as new) following the planned or unplanned correction of the Bearing Failure Risk.
Rules for Resetting Risks
You can specify any Risk that is defined for an Asset as a source Risk or an additional Risk, with a few exceptions. When you set up a simulation to include source Risks and additional Risks, you must follow these rules:
You can specify a Risk as a source Risk if the failure type for that Risk is:
Failure With Replacement
-or-
Failure Without Replacement
You can specify a Risk as an additional Risk only if the failure type for that Risk is Failure With Replacement.
In the simulation, only Risks whose failure type is Failure With Replacement are reset following a planned or unplanned correction. Risks whose failure type is Failure Without Replacement are not reset following planned or unplanned correction because the components associated with these Risks are not replaced (or repaired to as good as new). Specifically, this means that a Risk whose failure type is Failure Without Replacement:
Can be specified as a source Risk. In other words, the planned or unplanned correction of these Risks can trigger additional Risks to be reset, if the failure type of the additional Risks is Failure With Replacement.Cannot be specified as additional Risks. The rows containing Risks whose failure type is Failure Without Replacement are disabled.
Example: Rules for Resetting Risks
Suppose that the following Risks with the following failure types are defined for a Shell and Tube Heat Exchanger:
A Tube Bundle Failure Risk whose failure type is Failure Without Replacement.A Shell Head Failure Risk whose failure type is Failure With Replacement.A Seals (gaskets) Failure Risk whose failure type is Failure With Replacement.
Now suppose that when you complete planned or unplanned correction for the Tube Bundle Failure Risk, though you will not replace (or repair to as good as new) the Tube Bundle, you will replace (or repair to as good as new) the Seals (gaskets). In this case, you want to indicate in your simulation that the Tube Bundle Failure Risk is a source Risk that should trigger the resetting of the Seals (gaskets) Failure Risk (i.e., an additional Risk). In other words, the time that the Seals (gaskets) has been in service will be changed to zero (0) to reflect that the Seals (gaskets) will be replaced (or repaired to as good as new) following the planned or unplanned correction of the Tube Bundle Failure Risk.
