US254542Table 2. Resolved Issues
The following issues that existed in one or more previous releases have been resolved.
DescriptionTracking IDPreviously, in the Track workspace, if you added a Tracking Item and then navigated to the Analysis Summary page, the Track Item chart was not updated with Tracking Item that you added. This issue has been resolved. DE103448Previously, when viewing the Logic Tree diagram in the Comprehensive Analysis Report, the diagram appears in multiple pages. This issue has been resolved. Now, the Logic Tree diagram appears in a single page in the Comprehensive Analysis Report. DE103237Previously, when viewing the Logic Tree Diagram, depending on the size of your screen, the Auto Arrange check box overlapped other elements in the Manage Diagram section. This issue has been resolved. To facilitate this fix, the Auto Arrange option has been moved to the More Options () menu.DE101794Previously, after successfully processing data, the data loader log displayed a record count of 0. Now, the data loader log displays the correct record count.DE100707Previously, in a Logic Tree Diagram, you could reposition the nodes even if the Auto Arrange check box was selected. This issue has been resolved. Now, if the Auto Arrange check box is selected, the nodes in the Logic Tree cannot be repositioned. DE100121Previously, in the Analysis Summary page for an RCA Analysis that had more than two linked Recommendation records, if you selected the Recommendations chart, the grid that appeared below the chart only included two Recommendations records because the grid did not include a vertical scroll bar. This issue has been resolved. Now, a vertical scroll bar appears, and all linked Recommendation records appear in the grid. DE91498Previously, in an RCA Logic Tree, if you enabled the Show Logic Gates option, an OR Logic Gate appeared below each node in the Logic Tree by default. This behavior occurred even if there was only one child node below the parent node. This issue has been resolved. Now, if you enable the Show Logic Gates option when there is only one child node below a parent node, the OR Logic Gate does not appear. DE90271Previously, in an RCA Logic Tree, if the Show Logic Gates option was enabled, and if you added a single child Hypothesis node under either a parent Hypothesis node or a Failure Mode node, the Logic Gate incorrectly appeared between the single child and the parent nodes. This issue has been resolved. Now, if the Show Logic Gates option is enabled and you add a single child Hypothesis node under either a parent Hypothesis node or a Failure Mode node, the Logic Gate does not appear between the single child and the parent nodes. DE90090Previously, when viewing reports in RCA, the Logic Tree Diagram contained in the report was often disjointed and spanned multiple pages. This issue has been resolved. Now, when viewing a Logic Tree Diagram within an RCA report, the Logic Tree Diagram appears on a single page. DE90089Previously, if you exported a Logic Tree diagram, the exported diagram did not load properly, and you could not save the exported diagram. This issue has been resolved. DE89932Previously, when viewing the Logic Tree workspace in a browser in full-screen mode, the text from the Auto Arrange check box overlapped the Properties button (). This issue has been resolved. DE89929Previously, when viewing an RCA Analysis, if you selected the Event Diagram tab, the Decision node was not available in the Palette section, and no other nodes could be dragged from the Palette section. This issue has been resolved. Now, if you access the Event Diagram tab from an existing RCA Analysis, all nodes appear and can be dragged from the Palette section as expected. DE89734
