Export the Chart DataYou can export the data in an existing chart or analysis template to a CSV file. About This Task
The ability to export the data in the charts allows you to create artifacts and capture the underlying data that was used to arrive at a decision during analysis of your assets.
You can export data from a selected unsaved chart or an analysis template. Analysis templates may contain multiple cards and charts, and can be a private or system templates, and class or instance analysis templates. The file contains all data for all tags plotted within the current date and time range. Tag expressions and reference curves are treated similarly to tags while exporting the data.
If you have set a preferred time zone for the template, the Start Date, End Date, and Time timestamps are exported for the selected time zone. 
The downloaded file is named GE Digital APM_<current asset instance name>_<current YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ss>.csv. The downloaded file must be configured to appear properly.
The CSV file includes the following data:Time Zone Start Date/TimeEnd Date/TimeData Resolution valueData Resolution value (raw, if selected)Tag names (in columns) Note: Tag expressions and reference curves are considered tags.Tag Description (in columns)Alias names when defined (in columns)Units of Measure for tags (in columns)Note: The standard unit of measure for plotted tags appears. Quality of data filter Time stamp for each row.Tag values if present (in columns)
The standard unit of measure for plotted tags appears if the source unit of measure has been converted to standard unit of measure. If the source unit of measure is not converted, then the source unit of measure does not appear.

When investigating an issue, you might want to view a chart for different date ranges or durations. GE Digital APM provides a way to set the date range for the analysis. This impacts all the charts in that template.
The plotted data over a range of time selected appears on the Date Range Calendars, including the selected time zone. The calendars allow you to enter clock times based on twelve-hour-ranges for AM and PM Date ranges affect the data resolution, data available, and timeline zoom capability. Date Range Calendars have the following preset date ranges available:Last 1 DayLast weekLast monthLast 3 monthsLast 6 monthsLast 12 months
Tags that do not have data available for the time range selected do not plot on the charts; however, they are still available in the Plotted Tags list in the Tag Tree Browser. Filters are not saved on a template for plotted tag expressions when the date range is changed. Changing the time zone affects how the date range appears.
Date ranges are saved when creating an Analysis Template. Date ranges may be preset in the Alert Template. You can still change a date range that is set using the Alert Template.
ProcedureIn the module navigation menu, go to

If you want to refresh the data to the current time, the date or time refresh option would update to 10 Jan, 2022 0930 AM to 17 Jan, 2022 0930 AM.
Note:
For a SmartSignal card, when you modify the date range using the calendar in a non-points mode, selecting Apply on the calendar refreshes the data automatically. However, when you modify the date range using the calendar in the SmartSignal template, you must select Apply on the template to view the refreshed data.In the points mode of a SmartSignal card, select Today to set the date to the current day.

The date range changes based on your selections.About Saving TemplatesYou can create custom analysis views associated with an asset instance or class and save them as templates for use with specific alert types.You can save both a Time Series Analysis or an Event Data Analysis view as a template. Templates are saved to the System Templates or My Templates list, for public or private templates. Templates can be saved as an iteration or class. You can save a template that includes special characters in the tag names. Once created, you can associate a new analysis view as a template with an alert template, automating the view for that type of alert.When you create and save an analysis view, the view also records information about asset applicability and accessibility. Analysis views can be updated and deleted.Note: Before deleting an analysis view, make sure that there are no alert template associations. This action cannot be undone.The Context Ribbon on the analysis view includes options and displays information about its state.You can save an analysis view with tags containing no data for the current date range. When you add a tag with no data to a chart, the plotted tags list displays the tag as disabled. The  icon indicates that no data is available. When the date range is changed to include tag data, the plotted tags list displays the tag as enabled, and the view plots the data. Filtering for plotted tags and tag expressions can be saved as part of an analysis template, however, when a date range is changed for a plotted tag expression on a template, the filter is not saved.The  icon indicates that tags may not be present for different assets in the same classification.Applicable scenarios include the following outcomes: Table 1.
