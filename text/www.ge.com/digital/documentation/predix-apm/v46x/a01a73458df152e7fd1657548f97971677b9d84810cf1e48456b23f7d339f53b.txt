Production AnalysesAbout Production AnalysisProduction Analysis provides a visual representation of production output and allows you to quantify production losses and the cost associated with them. With regular use of Production Analysis, your company can determine where you are losing the most money and then take corrective actions that will help yield higher production and earn greater profits.Production Analysis allows you to evaluate the reliability of manufacturing processes. GE Digital APM Production Analysis analyzes production output data to help you see patterns in the output and determine the reliability of those processes. Often, a great amount of profit is lost due to production problems, rather than just Asset problems. Therefore, analyzing losses due to operational problems is necessary for conducting a comprehensive analysis of production losses. To quantify losses due to operational problems, in addition to analyzing individual Asset, you must also analyze the process in which they are involved. To do this, you can use a Production Analysis.Within a Production Analysis, you can plot production output data and then:Define the observed production output with a Demonstrated Line.Determine the reliability of the production process by defining a Process Reliability Line.Define the ideal production output with a Nameplate Line.Draw one or more Custom Lines to exhibit losses and gains compared to other observed production output or based on theoretical scenarios.Compare the observed output to the ideal output to calculate the efficiency and utilization costs.Production Process
The following example explains a simple production process.
Consider the process of manufacturing bottled water, which might consist of the following steps:
Collect water from spring.Fill bottles.Attach labels.Attach caps.Sort bottles, discard any that fail quality inspection, and package for shipping.
All of these steps must be completed to produce a finished product. In our example, the production unit consists of the individual pieces of equipment that together perform the steps in the process. The production output of this unit is bottles of water ready to be sold.
For our example, we will assume that we collect production output as the number of bottles produced per day. We will also assume that we began producing bottled water on January 1, 2000. Once a year we generate a Production Analysis to evaluate the actual production output, to calculate losses compared to the ideal production output, and to establish goals for improving production the following year.
About BreakpointOn a Production Data Plot, you will draw the Process Reliability Line to identify your Reliability Loss Region. Datapoints below the Process Reliability Line help make up the Reliability Loss Region. Typically, the Reliability Loss Region will show large variations in output that can be attributed to problems that impact the production process significantly, such as equipment and location failures, system shutdowns, and intentional cutbacks. For example, if you collect production output data daily and the system is shut down completely for five days during your collection period, then five datapoints will have near-zero values. These values should be easily distinguishable from the rest of the values in the Reliability Loss Region.To calculate your Reliability Losses accurately, you may want to separate the datapoints associated with shutdowns from the datapoints where losses are attributed to actual equipment slowdowns or intentional cutbacks. You can use the breakpoint tool to separate the Reliability Loss Region into these categories. The breakpoints will be taken into account in calculations so that your Reliability Losses represent losses due to actual equipment and location problems. Breakpoints also can be used to identify areas of distinct change in output when you do not know the reason for the change.Breakpoints for Bottled Water Production Process
Consider our example of a bottled water production process. In the following example, you can view the datapoints associated with unplanned shutdowns due to uncontrollable issues (e.g., lack of raw material), where the production output is near zero.



To separate this region from the rest of the reliability losses, we can create a breakpoint on the highest Reliability value within that distinct region. After the breakpoint has been created, GE Digital APM automatically shades the different regions of production output.
Now two shaded Reliability Loss regions are visible on the Production Data Plot. The gray area represents losses associated with unplanned and planned shutdowns, and the purple area represents the losses due to equipment and location failures and intentional cutbacks. All reliability losses will be calculated for each region and will appear as Sub Reliability Loss regions on the Production Loss Regions section. 

Note:  You can create more than one breakpoint when your production output displays more than two regions of shutdowns, Asset failures, intentional cutbacks, or other unknown variations.
About Results of a Production AnalysisAfter you have created your Production Analysis, defined your production lines, defined a Process Reliability Line, created any desired breakpoints, and customized the analysis to your liking, you can interpret the results to determine where to take corrective actions. Consider the following completed Production Analysis for our bottled water process.In the previous image, we have labeled three shaded regions:
Sub Reliability Loss Region 1 (gray): The area between the first datapoint above the breakpoint datapoint and the Demonstrated Line, below the Process Reliability Line. This represents the production from all unintentional equipment slowdowns and intentional cutbacks.
Sub Reliability Loss Region 2 (purple): The area between the breakpoint datapoint below the breakpoint datapoint and the Demonstrated Line, below the Process Reliability Line. This represents the production from all intentional and unintentional shutdowns.
Efficiency/Utilization Losses (pink): The area between the Demonstrated Line (blue) and the Nameplate Line (green).Each area represents the production losses associated with the corresponding set of datapoints. The losses are calculated and appear on the Production Loss Regions pane. In the following table, we list our losses from least to greatest.RegionQuantity LostCostEfficiency/Utilization Losses 279,586.89 $838,762 Sub Reliability Loss Region 1 214,000.54 $642,002 Sub Reliability Loss Region 2 31,447.89 $94,344 Note: The shaded regions in the plot can sometimes be misleading. For example, in this case the Sub Reliability Loss Region 2 is the largest region on the graph. If you look at the loss calculations, however, this region is associated with the second least amount of loss. You should always refer to the loss calculations to determine which region is responsible for the highest loss.The loss calculations can help you determine where to focus your attention to make improvements. You should focus first on the area that is responsible for the greatest amount of loss.Many companies automatically focus their attention on Asset failures. In this example, however, Asset reliability problems account for less loss than process problems. Therefore, in this case, we should focus on improving the process before we focus on improving equipment and location reliability. The analysis indicates that even if we repair the equipment, we will probably still experience losses due to process problems.If, as in our example, your analysis indicates that you should focus on correcting process problems, the steps you take will vary, depending upon the process itself and what you suspect the problems to be. For example, if we suspect that poor employee performance is the cause of our process problems, attempts at lowering the process problems for our bottled water process example might begin with monitoring the employees and possibly creating individual Production Analyses with production output for each employee every month. Also, we might ask a manager to monitor the work of the employees and report any observed problems. Employees might need to be replaced based on production numbers and observations. This would be the first step in helping us achieve the stretch goal for the end of 2007.If, on the other hand, the analysis indicated that equipment and location problems were responsible for the greatest production loss, then conducting a Reliability Distribution Analysis on the piece of equipment or location may be useful to predict the next Time to Failure and make repairs or replacements before failures occur.Access a Production AnalysisProcedure

Collect Data for a Production Analysis
To create a Production Analysis, you must collect production output information, which consists of numeric values representing the output of a process over some period of time. How you collect the output data and how often you collect it is up to you and may be determined based on a variety of factors, including the type of process, how often the process produces measurable output, and how often you want to record it. While the amount of time between output readings is up to you, you must collect the output data at regular intervals (e.g., hourly, daily, weekly, or monthly) to create a meaningful analysis. This will ensure that you are able to compare the output values to one another.
Details
When you create a Production Analysis from within the Production Analysis module, you can supply data to the analysis using a 
GE Digital APM query or dataset, or you can enter data manually. To use a query as the basis for your analysis, the production output data must be stored in the GE Digital APM database so that it can be queried. For example, you might store production data in custom Production Output records that you create and associate with the systems for which you record regular output readings.
You can also create a Production Analysis from within the Production Loss Analysis (PLA) module. PLA allows you to create production plans and then record daily production output against the plan. You can use these production output values as the starting point for a Production Analysis.
Note: If you are using PLA to collect production data, the GE Digital APM system provides the Production Data family to store the output readings.
The production output data is collected for a process, not for individual pieces of equipment. A single process may involve one or more pieces of equipment. Throughout this documentation and in the GE Digital APM Production Analysis tool, we refer to this collection of equipment as the production unit. The term unit refers to the process and all the pieces of equipment involved in it. It does not imply a GE Digital APM family or a specific record in the database.
Note: If you are using PLA to collect production data, the GE Digital APM system provides the Production Unit family for use within the PLA workflow.
Production Data
If you are using a query or dataset to store production output data, the following table lists the fields whose values you can provide to the analysis (through the Production Analysis Builder). The source data must include at least production output values.

DataDescriptionNotesProduction Output Values representing the amount of output produced by the unit during the specified period of time (e.g., hourly, daily, weekly, or monthly). These values must be numeric. You can define the units of measure for the output values after you create the analysis. Production Output values are required for creating a Production Analysis. Production Date The date on which the production output value was recorded. If you have a date field within your query or dataset and you choose not to map it to the Production Analysis Builder, you can see the dates used to build the analysis in the 
Production Analysis Points Editor window. Production Dates are optional. Unit ID A value that describes the production unit, which consists of the individual pieces of equipment that work together to produce the production output. You may have more than one Unit ID value within the Production Analysis and may group your datapoints by that specific value. Units are optional.
