Field CaptionData TypeDescriptionBehavior and UsageAnalysis ID Character The name of the Reliability Growth Analysis. This field is populated with the value in the Analysis ID field of the Reliability Growth record to which the Growth Model is linked. Beta Number A value that represents the slope of the Cumulative Failures plot. This feld is populated with the Beta value calculated by the GE Digital APM system. The Beta value indicates whether the MTBF is increasing, decreasing, or remaining constant. GOF Critical Value Number The value used to determine whether the analysis passed the goodness of fit (GOF) test. This value is calculated by the GE Digital APM system. If the value in this field is greater than the value in the GOF Statistic field, the Passed GOF field is set to True. GOF Statistic Number A value that demonstrates the preciseness of fit. This value is calculated by the GE Digital APM system. If the value in this field is less than the value in the GOF Critical Value field, the Passed GOF field is set to True.

If there is a difference, this field will be populated with the difference between beginning operating time and beginning observation time. Passed GOF LogicalIndicates whether the model passed the Goodness-of-Fit test or not. The analysis passes the GOF test when the value in the GOF Statistic field is less than the value in the GOF Critical Value field. Sequence Number The chronological order of this model in the analysis. This field is populated with the segment number that corresponds to the Growth Model record. If there is only one segment, this field is populated automatically with 1 (None). Time Terminated LogicalIndicates if the end date of the model is time-based.

Data for event-based analysis using failure dates
<Measurement Name>Tab

Field CaptionData TypeDescriptionBehavior and UsageAsset ID Character The ID of the Asset that failed.This value is mapped from a query or dataset or manually entered when you create the analysis. Cumulative Time <units> Number The Cumulative Time to Failure, which is the total runtime for a population of Assets at the moment that a failure occurs in one of them.Values in this field are calculated by the GE Digital APM system and are read-only. Date Date The date on which the failure occurred.
This value is mapped from a query or dataset or manually entered when you create the analysis and is required. If you delete a value in the Date field for an event-based analysis that is based on dates, when you select Finish, an error message will appear.
Downtime Units Number The amount of time that passed from the time the Asset failed until it was returned to service.This information helps determine the total operating time of a piece of equipment or location. <Units> corresponds with the value selected in the Time Units list on the Provide Information for Downtime screen for the analysis.Failures Number The number of failures represented by each datapoint. Cells in this column will contain the value 1 (one) by default, which indicates that the analysis data is not grouped, and one datapoint represents one failure. A value that is not equal to 1 (one) indicates that the analysis data is grouped, and each datapoint represents more than one failure or an amount of data.This value can optionally be mapped from a query or dataset or manually entered when you create the analysis.Ignore LogicalA check box field that indicates whether or not the data on the selected row is ignored.When selected, the data in the associated row will be excluded from the analysis. When cleared, data in the selected row will be included in the analysis. You can modify this value manually. Remarks Character Comments about the failure.You can enter a value in this field manually.Segment LogicalThe segment to which the data belongs. Values displayed in this field are read-only. Time <units> Number The Time to Failure, which is the amount of time between the date the Asset was put into service until the date that it failed. If the data includes an installation date for the Asset , this value is calculated from the installation date. If the data does not include an installation date, this value is calculated from the first failure. <Units> corresponds to the value selected in the Operating Time Units list on the Time Unit field for the analysis.This value is calculated automatically by the GE Digital APM system. If the value in this field is greater than the value in the GOF Statistic field, the Passed GOF field is set to True. 

Assets Tab

Field CaptionData TypeDescriptionBehavior and UsageAsset IDCharacter The Record ID of the Asset that is being analyzed.This value is mapped from a query or dataset or manually entered when you create the analysis.Installation Date Date The date on which the Asset was installed.This field appears only for analyses based on failure dates. This value is mapped from a query or dataset or manually entered when you create the analysis.Last Replacement Date Number  The last date or time at which the Asset failed.Values in this column are calculated by the GE Digital APM system and are read-only. For data that contains cumulative operating time, this field is Last Replacement <Measurement>.

Data for event-based analysis using cumulative operating time
<Measurement Name> Tab

Field CaptionData TypeDescriptionBehavior and UsageAsset IDCharacter The ID of the Asset that failed.This value is mapped from a query or dataset or manually entered when you create the analysis. COT <units> Number The Cumulative Operating Time, which is the total amount of time that has passed since the Asset was placed into service.

<Units> corresponds with the value selected in the Time Units list on the Select Data Fields screen for the analysis. This field is sorted in ascending order by default. This value is mapped from a query or dataset or manually entered when you create the analysis, and is required.
Note: For analyses based on cumulative operating time, if the values in the Failure Date column are not in the same order as the values in the COT (units) column (e.g., if the Failure Date 1/1/2012 has a COT of 1000 and the Failure date 1/2/2012 has a COT of 990), when you select OK, a message will appear, stating that sorting cumulative operating time values from smallest to largest will result in failure dates that are not in order from earliest to latest. As a result, no dates will be shown in the analysis results; only cumulative operating time will be shown.
Cumulative Time <units> Number The Cumulative Time to Failure, which is the total runtime for a population of Assets at the moment that a failure occurs in one of them.
Values in this field are calculated by the GE Digital APM system and are read-only. 
Note: The Cumulative Time is the total runtime for a piece of equipment or location after the analysis has started. This may be different from the COT, which is the total runtime of the piece of equipment or location since it was created. In our example, the haul truck has a mileage of 11,028 before the analysis starts, and fails at a mileage of 27,393. The COT is the total mileage on the truck, 27,293. The Cumulative Time is the mileage the truck has run since the analysis started (27,393-11,028=16,365). If the piece of equipment or location is brand new (i.e., the truck has a mileage of 0), the Cumulative Time and the COT will be the same. 
Date Date The date on which the failure occurred.
This value is mapped from a query or dataset or manually entered when you create the analysis and is required. If you delete a value in the Date field for an event-based analysis that is based on dates, when you select Finish, an error message will appear. 
This value is optional, but in order for dates to be displayed throughout the analysis, ALL failures must have a failure date. If one or more failure dates are missing, then no dates will be shown in the analysis; only cumulative operating time will be shown. For instance, in Example 2, the data does not include dates on which the haul truck broke down, so the analysis results will be able to predict the next failure in cumulative operating times only (e.g., the next failure will occur at 324,001 miles).
Failures Number The number of failures represented by each datapoint. Cells in this column will contain the value 1 (one) by default, which indicates that the analysis data is not grouped, and one datapoint represents one failure. A value that is not equal to 1 (one) indicates that the analysis data is grouped, and each datapoint represents more than one failure or an amount of data.This value can optionally be mapped from a query or dataset or manually entered when you create the analysis.Ignore LogicalA check box field that indicates whether or not the data on the selected row is ignoredWhen selected, the data in the associated row will be excluded from the analysis. When cleared, data in the selected row will be included in the analysis. You can modify this value manually. Remarks Character Comments about the failure.You can enter a value in this field manually.Segment LogicalThe segment to which the data belongs. Values displayed in this field are read-only. 

Assets Tab

Field CaptionData TypeDescriptionBehavior and UsageAsset ID Character The Record ID of the Asset that is being analyzed.This value is mapped from a query or dataset or manually entered when you create the analysis.Last Replacement Number  The last date or time at which the Asset failed.Values in this column are calculated by the GE Digital APM system and are read-only. For data that contains cumulative operating time, this field is Last Replacement <Measurement>.

Data for grouped non-event based analysis
<Measurement Name> Tab

Field CaptionData TypeDescriptionBehavior and UsageCostNumber The cost measured at each datapoint. For grouped data, values in this column represent the amount of data (e.g., cost) recorded between that datapoint and the previous datapoint. For non-grouped data, which is used in Examples 1 and 2, the values in this field are always 1 (one). For grouped data, the values can be greater than or less than 1 (one) but must be greater than 0 (zero).
This value is mapped from a query or dataset or manually entered when you create the analysis. The name of this column depends on the measurement name you are using for your analysis.
