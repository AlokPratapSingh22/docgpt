This section is disabled at the TML level.
The check boxes correspond to the following fields on the Corrosion Analysis Settings datasheet:

Least Squares corresponds to Corrosion Rate Options - Least Square.
Short Term corresponds to Corrosion Rate Options - Short Term.
Long Term corresponds to Corrosion Rate Options - Long Term.
By default, the Short Term and Long Term check boxes are selected.
If custom corrosion rates are enabled, additional check boxes will be visible that correspond to those corrosion rates. Custom corrosion rates are only available in the on-premises version of GE Digital APM.
Additionally, the check boxes determine the data that will be plotted on the TML Trends Graph.
Corrosion Rate Variance NumericSpecifies a value for the amount of variation that is allowed between the Short Term Corrosion Rate in the related TML Corrosion Analysis, and the Minimum Corrosion Rate.

The value in this field is only considered if it is greater than 0. 
Default Inspection Interval NumericSpecifies in months the default interval for inspections for the TML.
This field is used to populate the Interval Next Inspection Date field in the related TML Corrosion Analysis. 
Default T-Min NumericSpecifies the default minimum thickness value for calculations in the related corrosion analysis.
This field is disabled at the TML level.
If the related TML Corrosion Analysis has no value in the Minimum Thickness field, the value in this field is used instead.

When the Factor Remaining Life check box is selected, the Remaining Life Factor field is used to calculate the Factor Remaining Life Date field in the related TML Corrosion Analysis.
When the Inspection Interval check box is selected, the Default Inspection Interval field is used to calculate the Interval Next Inspection Date field.
Minimum Corrosion Rate NumericSpecifies the default minimum corrosion rate value for calculations in the related corrosion analysis.
If a corrosion rate cannot be determined in the related corrosion analysis, the value in this field is used instead.
Minimum Number of TMLs Numeric Specifies the minimum number of TMLs that must be used to calculate the Average Corrosion Rate when the Percentile field is less than 100.
This field is only considered if the Controlling Corrosion Rate is set to Average.
When the value in the Percentile field excludes TMLs from being used to calculate the Average Corrosion Rate, the value in this field ensures a minimum number of TMLs are still used to make the calculation.
For example, assume the Minimum Number of TMLs field was set to 20. If the value in the Percentile field determined that only the 10 TMLs with the highest rate of corrosion linked to an asset should be used to calculate Average Corrosion Rate, the value in the Minimum Number of TMLs field would take precedence, and the 20 TMLs highest rate of corrosion would be used instead. 
By default, the value in this field is 1.
Percentile NumericSpecifies what percentage of TMLs linked to an asset should be used to calculate Average Corrosion Rate.
This field is only considered if the Controlling Corrosion Rate is set to Average.
This field determines the percentage of TMLs linked to an asset or TML Group that will be used to calculate the Average Corrosion Rate for the related Asset Corrosion Analysis. The TMLs used will always be those with the most conservative (highest) corrosion rates.
For example, if you have an asset with 50 linked TMLs, and the Percentile field is set to 20, the 10 TMLs with the highest rate of corrosion will be used to calculate the Average Corrosion Rate for the asset.
By default, value in this field is 100, which means all TMLs linked to an asset are used to calculate the Average Corrosion Rate.
Piping AssetBoolean When selected, indicates that the Asset is a Piping Asset and suitable for Piping Rotation.
This field is always disabled at the child level of the parent asset.
This field is enabled only if you enable the piping rotation workflow from the TM Admin Preferences page.

This field is disabled at the TML level.
The value in this field must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 1. It is only used to multiply the value in the Remaining Life field in the related TML Corrosion Analysis if the Factor Remaining Life check box is selected.
Safety Factor NumericSpecifies a value that is used to multiply the calculated average in order to determine the Average Corrosion Rate.
This field is only considered if the Controlling Corrosion Rate is set to Average.
The value in this field is used as a multiplier for the Average Corrosion Rate in an Asset Corrosion Analysis, which determines the displayed value in the Average Corrosion Rate field.
By default, the value in this field is 1, which means the actual Average Corrosion Rate will be used.
Std Deviation Factor NumericSpecifies a value that is used to determine outliers when calculating Statistical Corrosion Rate. 
This field is only considered if the Controlling Corrosion Rate is set to Formula.
The value in this field is used as a multiplier for TML CR SD when calculating the Statistical Corrosion Rate in the related Asset Corrosion Analysis.
By default, the value in this field is 2.
Use Minimum Corrosion Rate BooleanWhen selected, indicates that when the calculated corrosion rate for a TML is less than the Minimum Corrosion Rate, the Minimum Corrosion Rate will be used for calculations instead.
This field is disabled at the TML level.
When the check box is selected, the value in the Minimum Corrosion Rate field will be used for calculations in place of the value in the Corrosion Rate field in the related TML, if that value is less than the Minimum Corrosion Rate. 
Note: If the Use Minimum Corrosion Rate check box is cleared and only one Thickness Measurement is linked to a TML, the Minimum Corrosion Rate will be used.
