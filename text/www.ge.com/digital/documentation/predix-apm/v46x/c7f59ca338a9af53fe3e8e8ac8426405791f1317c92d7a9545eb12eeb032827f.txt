Classifications OverviewAbout Asset and Tag ClassificationsA classification is collection of asset or tag instances with common characteristics.A classification is a modeling construct that allows a data modeler to design an asset model by identifying the common characteristics of assets or tags.For example, suppose you have a product line of bicycles: two-wheeled, three-wheeled, and four-wheeled. The common characteristic (or attribute) for each model in the line is number of wheels. A data modeler would add this attribute to the root asset classification when the asset instances are created they will inherit the custom attribute for number of wheels. If there are additional common attributes for bicycles these can be added at the root asset classification as well.Classifications are added to GE Digital APM during ingestion by anyone with modify asset privileges.You can access classifications by selecting a link in an associated instance, or by searching criteria in Classifications.Create a ClassificationYou can create new root-classifications or child-classifications for each level in the business functional hierarchy. You can create new root-tag classifications or child-tag classifications.About This Task

Important: After you have created a classification, you cannot modify the placement of the classification in the business functional hierarchy. For information on deleting a classification from a Business Functional Object, refer to Delete a Classification for a Business Functional Object, and begin again.

You can create classifications in the business functional hierarchy as follows:Table 1. Available Classification TypesBeginning from hereYou can create this type of classificationEnterpriseYou can create a root-Enterprise or a child-Enterprise.SiteYou can create a root-Site or a child-Site.SegmentYou can create a root-Segment or a child-Segment.AssetYou can create root-Asset or a child-Asset.TagYou can create a root-Tag or a child-Tag.
When you create a new classification, you must define the following:Table 2. Classification DefinitionsFieldDescriptionClassification NameThe name of the new classification.(Optional) DescriptionA description of the new classification.Source IDA unique identifier for the new classification.Note: You can assign same source ID to different types of classification such as Enterprise, Site, Segment, Asset, and Tag in different cases.For example: TurbineSiteType (SiteType), turbinesitetype (AssetType), Turbinesitetype (TagType)(Optional) Position in Hierarchy check boxCreates the new classification at the root level in the hierarchy. You can select any Type as the root. This disables the Parent Classification box.TypeSpecifies the type of classification (Enterprise, Site, Segment, Asset, or Tag). Parent ClassificationAllows you to define the association in which the new classification is created as a child-classification. Selecting the Parent Classification drop-down list box allows you to select from the choices available.The Parent Classification is based on the Type selected. During creation of child-classifications, the Parent Classification created last displays by default. Otherwise, the first classification in the drop-down list box is displayed.If the Asset or Tag Type is selected as a classification type, you can search for a classification.
ProcedureIn the module navigation menu, go to
Assets >  Classifications.In the classification view, select .
Note: Classifications can be Enterprise, Site, Segment, Asset, or Tag.
The New Classification window appears.Enter the required information in the new classification form:Enter a classification name in the Classification Name box.Optional: Enter a description for the new classification in the Description box.Enter a sourcekey for the new classification in the Source ID box.Optional: If you want the new classification to be placed into the root level of the hierarchy, select the Set as top level node check box.
Important: Selecting this option disables the Parent Classification box.
Select an option in the Type drop-down list box.If you want to change the Parent Classification, choose from the following:
For an Enterprise, Site, or Segment Type selection, select an option in the Parent Classification box.For an Asset or Tag Type selection, select  in the Parent Classification box to access the Select Classification window. Enter your search criteria, and then select Select. For more information about how to select a classification, refer to the Find and Select a Parent Classification documentation.Tip:
The Parent Classification box is disabled if the Set as top level node check box is selected.The parent classifications associated with the Type selected appear as a list in the Parent Classification box by default. The Parent Classification is optionally preselected to the last created parent classification. If you are creating a classification that requires a different parent classification, you will need to change the selection.

Select Create.
Note: Create is disabled until all required fields have been completed.
The new classification appears. The classification includes the identifier information of the classification, including any inherited attributes. Instances created using the new classification are included in the selected column in the Context Browser.Create a Child-ClassificationYou can create child-classifications for each level in the business functional hierarchy. You can create new root-tag classifications or child-tag classifications.About This Task
You can create child-classification of any type in the business functional hierarchy. The child-classification inherits all the attributes from the root-classification. The datatype defined for the attributes in the root-classification remains same and cannot be changed. However, you can add or delete custom attributes. The instances also inherit attributes from the Classification or Type under which they have been created.
For example, if an attribute Rotor Diameter within Turbine Classification is defined as integer datatype, then all the instances of the Turbine populating value for the attribute Rotor Diameter must provide integer as datatype and values must comply to the datatype.

Important: After you have created a child-classification, you cannot modify the placement of the child-classification in the business functional hierarchy. For information on deleting a classification from a Business Functional Object, refer to Delete a Classification for a Business Functional Object, and begin again.

Important: Selecting the Set as top level node check box disables the Parent Classification box and places the classification into the root level of the hierarchy.
Note: By default, the child-classification has the same type as root-classification. However, you can change it to a different type such as Enterprise, Site, Segment, Asset, or Tag and select associated parent classification. For more information on type, refer to Create a Classification.
Select Create.The new child-classification appears. The child-classification includes the identifier information of the classification, including any inherited attributes. The custom attributes from the root-classification are copied to the inherited attributes in the child-classification. You can add more custom attributes in the child-classification; however, the attribute name cannot be same as the existing inherited attributes. Instances created using the new child-classification are included in the selected column in the Context Browser.Find and Select a Parent ClassificationYou can search for a specific Asset or Tag classification to use as a parent classification.About This Task
After selecting Asset or Tag as the Type while creating a classification, you can search for a parent classification to associate with the new classification.Note: Searching for a classification is only available if you have selected Asset or Tag as the Type while creating a classification.
