Overview







OverviewAbout European Inspection ManagementIn Germany, inspections of pressure-containing assets are regulated by the industrial safety regulation (BetrSichV). The aim of this regulation is to guarantee the protection of employees' health and safety when using work equipment. With this module, GE Digital APM will provide a solution to help categorize the inspection activities according to Government Regulation based on pressure, volume, and fluid characteristics. According to this categorization, Compliance Management module of GE Digital APM can recommend applicable inspection task types along with recommended interval based on each asset type. This module will also help you identify the certification requirements of Inspectors. For example, ZÜS (Approved Inspection Body) and bP (Qualified Person) based on the criticality of the asset. This functionality is fully integrated with Compliance Management module and Inspection Management module.
