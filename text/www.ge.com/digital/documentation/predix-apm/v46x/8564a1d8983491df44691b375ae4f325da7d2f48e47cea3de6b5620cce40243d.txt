CalculationsOverview of TM Calculations
A Corrosion Analysis includes one or more assets and all the TM-specific records that are linked to them. As you conduct a Corrosion Analysis, various calculations and validations are performed, and the results are stored in various records involved in the Corrosion Analysis.
In this section of the documentation, we provide descriptions of the calculations and validations that are performed within a Corrosion Analysis. These descriptions are classified according to the type of record for which the calculation or validation is performed:

Asset Corrosion Analysis: Stores summary information and calculations that are performed using the information in the related Thickness Measurement Location and Thickness Measurement records.

TML Corrosion Analysis: Stores summary information and calculations performed using the information in related Thickness Measurement Location and Thickness Measurement records.


Thickness Measurement: Stores measurement data and performs calculations. The values calculated in Thickness Measurement records are used for calculating values in the associated TML Corrosion Analysis record.

Thickness Monitoring uses specific formulas, equations, and estimation methods to arrive at the values that are stored in these records. In order to understand the information that is displayed to you for a given analysis, you must understand how the values were determined.
