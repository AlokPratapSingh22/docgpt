Family Field Descriptions Policy Records

 Policy records store basic information about policies. The following table provides an alphabetical list and description of the fields that exist in the Policy family and that are displayed on the baseline Policy datasheet (unless otherwise noted). The information in the table reflects the baseline state and behavior of these fields. This list is not comprehensive. 
This family is not enabled for site filtering, which means that records in this family can be accessed by any user with the appropriate license and family privileges. See the Site Filtering section of the documentation for more information.
By default, this family is configured to be included in global search and to use Rules.
Note:  The values in Policy records cannot be modified in Record Manager or accessed via the global search. Instead, you must access the policy in the policies interface. 
FieldData TypeDescriptionField Behavior and UsageActiveLogicalIndicates whether the policy is active or inactive.Reflects the selection of the activate/deactivate policy button in the Details workspace.Automatic EvaluationLogicalIndicates whether the policy logic will be executed automatically when records belonging to the policy instance are modified.Reflects the selection in the Automatic Execution check box in the Details workspace. Description TextA brief summary of the policy.Contains the value that you enter in the Description box on the Details workspace.Execution History SettingCharacterDefines how the execution history is recorded for the policy.Reflects the selection in the Execution History option in the Details workspace. The field is populated with the value Normal, by default. Model TextCode defining the logic that is represented by the policy model.This field is populated automatically and does not appear on the Policy datasheet.Name CharacterThe name of the policy.Contains the value that you specify in the Name box in the Details workspace.This field is required, and the value must be unique.OwnerCharacterThe owner of the policy.
Contains the policy owner that appears at the top of the Details workspace.
Only the owner of the policy can save changes to the policy.
This field is required. This field is configured to track revision history by default. You can look at the revision history for this field to determine the ownership history for a particular policy.
ScheduleCharacterCode defining the policy's schedule.This field is populated automatically and does not appear on the Policy datasheet.Schedule ExecutedBooleanIndicates whether the currently configured schedule has executed at least once.Populated automatically.ScheduledLogicalIndicates whether the policy has a defined execution schedule.Populated automatically.Time ZoneCharacterThe time zone associated with the policy.Contains the value that you specify in the Time Zone list in the Details workspace.This field contains the value (UTC) Coordinated Universal Time by default.
Policy Instance Records
Policy Instance records store information about policy instances that are associated with a policy. The following table provides an alphabetical list and description of the fields that exist in the Policy Instance family. The information in the table reflects the baseline state and behavior of these fields.
This family is not enabled for site filtering, which means that records in this family can be accessed by any user with the appropriate license and family privileges. See the Site Filtering section of the documentation for more information.
By default, this family is configured to be excluded from global search and to use Rules.
Note: The values in Policy Instance records cannot be modified in Record Manager. You must update the instance in the Policy Designer module in order to change values in the record.
FieldData TypeDescriptionBehavior and UsageActiveLogicalIndicates whether the instance is active or inactive.Reflects the selection of the activate/deactivate policy instance button in the Instances pane.IDCharacterThe name of the instance.Populated automatically with the value that you enter in the Instance box in the Instances pane.MappingTextContains code that maps values from records belonging to the policy instance to the nodes in the associated policy model. 
This field is disabled and does not appear on the Policy Instance datasheet.
Policy GUIDCharacterA unique identifier that is used internally by the GE Digital APM system.
This field is disabled and does not appear on the Policy Instance datasheet.

Policy Event Records
Policy Event records store information about events that are associated with Equipment or Functional Location records that are monitored by a policy. The following table provides an alphabetical list and description of the fields that exist in the Policy Event family and that are displayed on the baseline Policy Event datasheet (unless otherwise noted). The information in the table reflects the baseline state and behavior of these fields. This list is not comprehensive.
This family is enabled for site filtering, which means that records in this family can be assigned to a specific site and will then only be accessible to users who are assigned to the same site and have the appropriate license and family privileges. See the Site Filtering section of the documentation for more information on using this feature.
By default, this family is configured to be excluded from global search and to use Rules.
FieldData TypeDescriptionBehavior and UsageClose DescriptionTextA description of why the event was closed.
Populated automatically based on the properties defined for the associated Create Event or Close Event node.
DescriptionTextA description of the event.
Populated automatically based on the properties defined for the associated Create Event node.
End TimeDateThe date on which the event ended.
Populated automatically based on the properties defined for the associated Create Event or Close Event node.
This field is used only when the Has Duration field is set to True.
Event TypeCharacterThe type of event.
Populated automatically based on the properties defined for the associated Create Event node.
Has DurationLogicalIndicates whether or not there is an end time associated with the event.
Populated automatically based on the properties defined for the associated Create Event node.
NameCharacterThe name of the event.
Populated automatically based on the properties defined for the associated Create Event node.
In the Execution History pane, this value will appear as a hyperlink that you can select to access the Events section in Asset Health Manager.
Policy Instance GUIDCharacterA unique identifier that is used internally by the GE Digital APM system.On the Policy Event datasheet, this field is labeled Link to Policy and contains a link to the policy instance that created the Policy Event record.SeverityCharacterThe severity of the event.
Populated automatically based on the properties defined for the associated Create Event node.
Start TimeDateThe date on which the event started.
Populated automatically based on the properties defined for the associated Create Event node.
Time Line ResetLogicalThis field is not currently used.N/A
Policy Recommendation Records
Policy Recommendation records store basic information about recommendations that have been created as a result of a policy. The following table provides an alphabetical list and description of some of the fields that exist in the Policy Recommendation family. The information in the table reflects the baseline state and behavior of these fields. This list is not comprehensive.
This family is enabled for site filtering, which means that records in this family can be assigned to a specific site, and will only be accessible to users who are assigned to the same site and have the appropriate license and family privileges. For more information, refer to the Sites section of the documentation.
By default, this family is configured to be included in global search and to use Rules.
