Reliability Distribution: OverviewOverview of Reliability Distribution AnalysisReliability Analytics
The Reliability Analytics module provides a collection of tools that apply reliability engineering principles to help you make tactical (short-term) and strategic (long-term) decisions for maintenance and operational equipment management activities. It also provides: A means for analyzing historical failure data to identify trends and predict future failures.A mechanism for simulating what if scenarios regarding the reliability of a system to determine if a new or modified strategy will be effective. The Reliability Analytics module provides the following types of tools: Production AnalysisSystem Reliability AnalysisSpares AnalysisReliability Distribution AnalysisProbability Distribution AnalysisReliability Growth AnalysisAutomation Rules
                                Each tool provides a unique set of features that allow you to analyze data to develop strategies to improve reliability.
Reliability Distribution Analysis
Reliability Distribution Analysis is a tool that allows you to create a statistical distribution that describes how Time to Failure is distributed over the lifetime of equipment. With a closer look at the individual failure mode over one or multiple pieces of equipment, you will be able to identify trends and predict future failures.
Reliability Distribution Analysis WorkflowThis workflow provides the basic, high-level steps for developing Reliability Distribution Analysis. The steps and links in this workflow do not necessarily reference every possible procedure.

Collect failure data
.
Create a new Reliability Distribution analysis from a GE Digital APM query or dataset, or from manually entered data. The Reliability Distribution Analysis should be based on the failure data collected in the previous step.

Evaluate the results
 of conducting the Reliability Distribution Analysis.
