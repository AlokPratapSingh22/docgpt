Risk Based Inspection 581Deploy RBI 581 for the First TimeBefore You Begin

The following table outlines the steps that you must complete to deploy and configure this module for the first time. 
                
These tasks may be completed by multiple people in your organization. GE Digital recommends, however, that the tasks be completed in the order in which they are listed.

StepTaskNotes
1
Assign Security Users to one or more of the Security Roles used in RBI.
This step is required.

2

Add the following types of RBI 581 users to at least one >TM Security Group: 
Users who are responsible for completing the steps necessary to use TM Analysis values to calculate RBI 581 corrosion rates. Users who should be able to navigate to TM via RBI 581. 
This step is required only if you are using the integration between the RBI 581 and Thickness Monitoring modules
3
Select the Is a Unit? check box in Functional Location records that represent units in your facility.
This step is required, and marks Functional Location records as Process Units.

4
Using the Belongs to a Unit relationship, link Equipment records to Functional Location records representing units to which that equipment belongs (the Is a Unit? check box is selected).This step is optional.
5


Add the RBI-581 tab to the datasheet of the following families: 
Criticality RBI Component - Cylindrical Shell Criticality RBI Component - Exchanger Bundle Criticality RBI Component - Exchanger Header Criticality RBI Component - Exchanger Tube Criticality RBI Component - Piping Criticality RBI Component - Tank Bottom 
This step is required only for families for which you have customized the datasheet.9Update Risk Matrix Mappings and Policies to account for overridden financial consequence for RBI 581 Risk Analyses.The Operations Category on the Risk Matrix does not account for overridden financial consequence for RBI 581 Risk Analyses. If you are using this feature, you are required to update your Risk Matrix Mappings and Policies by following https://digitalsupport.ge.com/communities/en_US/Article/KNOWN-ISSUE-V4-Risk-Based-Inspection-Operations-Category-on-Risk-Matrix-does-not-account-for-overridden-financial-consequence-for-RBI-581-Risk-Analyses10Add RBI Component Types to the MI RBI COMPONENT TYPES system code table.This step is required only if you want to use additional RBI Component type records that are not provided in the baseline GE Digital APM database.
Upgrade RBI 581Before You Begin

The following tables outline the steps that you must complete to upgrade this module to the latest version of GE Digital APM
                    .
                
These tasks may be completed by multiple people in your organization. We recommend, however, that the tasks be completed in the order in which they are listed.

After you upgrade: 
All RBI Assets with Active Analyses will have a related Inspection Plan record created.All RBI recommendations which are not in the Archived state for an RBI Asset with Active Analyses will be related to Inspection Plan record of the RBI Asset.The state caption for RBI Recommendation family with State ID MI_ACCEPTED will be updated to Approved.The Recommendation Methodology field on RBI Recommendation will be updated to RBI 581 where previously the field had the value RBI 581 Recommendation.All security users who belong to the MI RBI Analyst security group will belong to the MI Inspection Plan Approver security role.The MI Inspection Plan Approver security role will have the MI ASM Analyst security group assigned.Piping Stress updatedIn some of the Piping Stress records for B31.3, WPB was misspelled as WFB. These records are now updated based on ASME standards.In some of the Piping Stress records for B31.3 and B31.1 for the year 2014, where the Material Specification field contained the value B366 and B622, the Material Grade had the value NS instead of N/A. These records are now updated based on ASME standards.The following new RBI 581 Representative Fluids will be added to match the API 581, 3rd Edition, Addendum 1 specification:Acid-LPAcid-MPAcid-HPC1-C2C3-C4C6-C8C9-C12For information on the new RBI 581 Representative Fluid Contents, refer to the RBI 581 Representative Fluids topic.RBI 581 Representative Fluid contents will be updated for the following fluids to match the API 581, 3rd Edition, Addendum 1 specification:C13-16 (Diesel)C17-25 (Gas Oil)C25+ (Resid)C5ChlorineCOEOH2H2O (Water)H2SHClHFMEOH (Methanol)NH3PhosgeneSteamFor information on the updated RBI 580 Representative Fluid Contents, refer to the RBI 581 Representative Fluids topic.RBI 581 Representative Fluid content will be updated for the following families to match the API 581, 3rd Edition, Addendum 1 specification:Component Damage FlammableToxic Release Constants HFH2SToxic Cons Eq ConstantToxic Cons Eq Misc Chem
