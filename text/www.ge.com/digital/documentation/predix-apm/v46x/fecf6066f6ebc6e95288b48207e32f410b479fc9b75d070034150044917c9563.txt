Asset Hierarchy Configuration
GE Digital APM is built on the premise that, within your company, there are multiple records that can be organized into a hierarchy. This organization relies on the parent-child relationship between records to represent the fact some records can belong to other records. The Hierarchy can be modified to reflect a custom family. However, the baseline configuration relies on the Functional Location family and the fields in each Functional Location record to define which location each represents. Because there is only one Functional Location family, it is used to store data about all of your locations, where the values in each Functional Location record identify which type of location it is.The baseline configuration assumes that Functional Locations have Functional Locations and that Equipment is found at the lowest levels of Functional Locations. For example, three pieces of equipment might belong to the same Functional Location, meaning the Functional Location resides on a higher level of the hierarchy than the Equipment.More Details: Baseline Configuration
In the baseline configuration, there are two levels reflected in the Asset Hierarchy: the Root and a secondary level. The primary level of the Hierarchy, the Root, reflects the Functional Location relationships. The second level of the hierarchy reflects Equipment related to Functional Locations. The hierarchy first displays the Root Function Location, and drills down to child Functional Locations based on your selections. The hierarchy will continue to do so until there are no child relationships for the selected Functional Location. Then, using the criteria defined in the second level, the hierarchy will display Equipment records related to the selected Functional Location.
The baseline configuration is as follows:

Root: The primary level of the hierarchy.
Parent Family: Functional Location
Relationship: Functional Location Has Functional Location(s)
Child Family: Functional Location
Display Field: Functional Location Description
Taxonomy Category: Taxonomy Category
Taxonomy Class: Taxonomy Class
Taxonomy Type: Taxonomy Type

Secondary Level: The second level of the hierarchy.
Parent Family: Functional Location
Relationship: Functional Location Has Equipment
Child Family: Equipment
Display Field: ENTY_ID
Taxonomy Category: Taxonomy Category
Taxonomy Class: Taxonomy Class
Taxonomy Type: Taxonomy Type

Important: Equipment or functional location with multiple parent functional location is not supported in Asset Hierarchy.To find the duplicate keys, run the below query in GE Digital APM:SELECT MV_AST_HRCY_DUP.parent_enty_key
, PAR_FMLY.FMLY_CAPTION_TX "PARENT_FMLY"
, MV_AST_HRCY_DUP.enty_key "CHILD_ENTY_KEY"
, CHILD_FMLY.FMLY_CAPTION_TX "CHILD_FMLY"
, MV_AST_HRCY_DUP.enty_id "CHILD_ENTY_ID"
, MV_AST_HRCY_DUP.the_level
, MV_AST_HRCY_DUP.path
FROM MIV_MI_AST_HRCY_MV_DUP MV_AST_HRCY_DUP
 JOIN MI_FAMILIES PAR_FMLY ON PAR_FMLY.FMLY_KEY = MV_AST_HRCY_DUP.parent_fmly_key
 JOIN MI_FAMILIES CHILD_FMLY ON CHILD_FMLY.FMLY_KEY = MV_AST_HRCY_DUP.fmly_key
ORDER BY MV_AST_HRCY_DUP.enty_key Asc
