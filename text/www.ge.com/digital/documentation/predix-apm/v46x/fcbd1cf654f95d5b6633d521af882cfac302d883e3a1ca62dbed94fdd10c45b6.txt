Table 2. Resolved Issues

This issue has been resolved.DE179882Previously, in the Time Series chart for an Analysis card, when you selected a date range that is greater than three months, an error message appeared and the Analysis page stopped responding. This issue has been resolved.DE177219Previously, analysis expressions that contained nested expressions did not get populated in the chart. This issue has been resolved.DE176527Previously, the Add Threshold Lines option in a plotted chart’s Settings drop-down menu did not work as expected. This issue has been resolved. DE175264Previously, while using the analysis X-Y scatter plot, after you closed an element and clicked a tag in the key, the Plotted Tags section re-opened for every tree element. Due to this you had to go through the long list of elements and close the elements that were not used and scroll down to see the name of the generic series. This issue has been resolved. Now, the current viewing card is expanded automatically, so that you do not have scroll down in the Plotted Tags section.DE164913
