SIL Verification







SIL VerificationAbout Safety Integrity Level (SIL) VerificationAfter you assess the SIL level of an instrumented function, you must verify if the safety instrumented system meets the targeted SIL level. To facilitate this verification, the SIL Verification feature allows you to create a protective instrument loop, and then calculate the SIL level for the loop.About Protective Instrument LoopsA protective instrument loop consists of interconnected instruments that work together to serve a function that is defined for the safety instrumented system within which they exist. When you create a protective instrument loop in SIS Management, you are creating a Protective Instrument Loop record. When you define the elements of the protective instrument loop (i.e., the interconnected instruments), you are creating records in the Protective Instrument Loop Element family and its subfamilies, and linking them to the Protective Instrument Loop. Throughout this documentation, when we refer to the protective instrument loop, we are referring to the Protective Instrument Loop and all the records that are linked to it. When we refer to Protective Instrument Loop Elements, we are referring to the records that are linked to the Protective Instrument Loop.Protective Instrument Loop Elements
Each instrument in a protective instrument loop is called an element. The following protective instrument loop elements are defined in the GE Digital APM system:
Logic SolverSensor System Sensor Group Sensor Final Element System Final Element Group Final Element 
By default, every protective instrument loop consists of at least one of each element. When you create a Protective Instrument Loop, the GE Digital APM system creates one record for each of these elements, and links to the Protective Instrument Loop as shown in the data model.
Protective Instrument Loop Diagram
A protective instrument loop diagram is a visual representation of the number of each type of elements in the protective instrument loop. The following image shows the baseline protective instrument loop diagram.



To access or modify the datasheet of a protective instrument loop element, you must select the corresponding node in the diagram. 
Important: If you have provided incorrect or insufficient information for a protective instrument loop element, then the GE Digital APM system cannot calculate the loop results. This is indicated by a  icon that appears in the diagram for that element. You must then review the details of the element in the datasheet.
About Protective Instrument Loop Calculation EngineGE Digital APM supports the following calculation engines for the calculation of loop results in an SIL analysis:exSILentia v3exSILentia v4The usage of exSILentia v4 calculation engine in GE Digital APM provides improved accuracy in the calculated results. In addition, the following functionalities are provided:You can specify if redundant I/O channels must be on separate modules for an instrumented function.You can specify group level Mission Time for a Sensor Group, Logic Solver, and Final Element Group.
The ability to specify a Proof Test Scope for Final Elements is available. The exSILentia v4 calculation engine includes updates as per the latest revision of IEC 61511. The basis for Architectural Constraints only includes IEC 61511:2016 and IEC 61508:2010.To enable a Protective Instrument Loop or Protective Instrument Loop Template to use the exSILentia v4 calculation engine, you must upgrade the loop.Safety Integrity Level (SIL) Verification WorkflowThis workflow provides the basic, high-level steps for performing a Safety Integrity Level (SIL) verification. The steps and links in this workflow do not necessarily reference every possible procedure.Performing an SIL Verification includes the following steps:
Create a Protective Instrument Loop. After you create a Protective Instrument Loop, the GE Digital APM system creates one record for each of its elements.
Provide the details of the following elements of the loop in the corresponding records:
 Sensor System  Sensor Group  Sensor  Logic Solver  Final Element System  Final Element Group  Final Element 
 If there are additional elements in the loop apart from the default ones, create records for them. The GE Digital APM system builds the diagram based on the elements that you have added. 
Compare the calculated results of the loop to verify if the Safety Integrity Level (SIL) target is achieved.About Asset Groups in SIS ManagementWhen you create an Instrumented Function in SIS Management, you can associate it with a piece of Equipment and a Functional Location. The piece of Equipment and the Functional Location together form an Asset. The Asset that is associated with the Instrumented Function is the asset that you are protecting. Similarly, when you create a Protective Instrument Loop, you can associate each element in the loop with a piece of Equipment and a Functional Location. The Assets that are associated with the individual Protective Instrument Loops are the ones that are required to protect the Asset associated with the Instrumented Function.The GE Digital APM system creates an asset group for each Protective Instrument Loop. This group contains all the Equipment and Functional Locations associated with each sensor, logic solver, and final element in the loop. This group is named in the following format: <The ID of the SIL Analysis ID>/<ID of the Instrumented Function>/<ID of the Protective Instrument Loop> Asset Group. The GE Digital APM system updates this group when you add a new element to the loop, remove an element from the loop, or associate an existing element with a new Equipment or Functional Location.You can search for these groups on the Assets page.About Validation Failure Rate Reference DataFailure rate reference data refers to data that exists to record trends in failure rates for categories of elements that exist in a protective instrument loop. These elements can be categorized by application, technology, size, or any other technical characteristic. Before you add an element to a protective instrument loop, you can consider the failure rate reference data that is associated with that element type, and then make a decision on whether or not to use that particular element.Validation failure rate reference data is available for the following records:Sensor Logic Solver Final Element The Is Reference Data check box in these records is set to True. Note: By default, the Is Reference Data check box is not included on the datasheet. This field is used by the GE Digital APM system, and is not meant to be modified manually.When you create a Protective Instrument Loop Element via the Validation Failure Rate Reference Data feature, the GE Digital APM system will automatically select the Is Reference Data check box in that record.About Approving a Device for Use
You can use the Validation Failure Rate Reference Data feature to determine which elements are approved for use with a protective instrument loop. After you have determined that a given element is approved, you can select the Approve button in the upper-right corner of the datasheet. When you do so, the GE Digital APM system will automatically select the Approved Custom Device check box in that record, and it will be available for selection in the SIL Verification feature.
If you later determine that an element is no longer approved for use in a protective instrument loop, you can revoke that approval in the record. 
Note: To approve a Protective Instrument Loop Element, you must be a member of the SIS Administrator or SIS Engineer Security Group.
About Copying a Protective Instrument Loop ElementWhen you copy a Protective Instrument Loop Element:The values in each field of the copied record are overwritten by those of the original record that you copy.The value in the Element ID field in the copied record is appended with 1.All the child records linked to the original record also become a part of the record that you copy, replacing the existing ones. For example, consider two protective instrument loops, Loop 1 and Loop 2, with the following sensor systems, sensor groups, and sensors:

Suppose you copy Sensor Group 3 into Sensor Group 1: The values for all the fields in Sensor Group 1 are overwritten by those in Sensor Group 3.The ID for Sensor Group 1 becomes Sensor Group 3 1.Sensor 1 and Sensor 2 are replaced by Sensor 3. If Sensor 1 and Sensor 2 are not part of another protective instrument loop, they are deleted. Otherwise, they are unlinked from Loop 1.The following image illustrates the changes in Loop 1 after you copy Sensor Group 3 :

About Dangerous Combination of OutputsWhen you define a Protective Instrument Loop Final Element, you must define the potential hazards that can occur if the output state associated with the final element is combined with the output state associated with another final element. While the output state associated with individual final elements is safe, in some cases, when output states associated with multiple final elements are combined, a hazardous event can occur. For example, if the output state associated with Final Element A has the potential to fill a tank half full, and the output state associated with Final Element B has the potential to fill the same tank half full, these combined output states have the potential to overflow the tank. In this way, Final Element A and Final Element B have a combined output state hazard.You can document combined output state hazards that exist for final elements in the Dangerous Combination of Outputs section in the Protective Instrument Loop Final Element. In other words, for each final element that participates in a potentially hazardous relationship, you will need to define the combined output state hazard(s) for that final element.Steps in Defining Dangerous Combination of Outputs
To define combined output state hazards for a final element, you must:
Link the Protective Instrument Loop Final Element to the other Protective Instrument Loop Final Element representing the final element whose output state can cause a hazard when combined with the output state of the current final element. Protective Instrument Loop Final Elements can be linked to one or more other Protective Instrument Loop Final Elements through the Has Hazardous Event relationship.Describe the hazardous event that can occur when the output states are combined. Since some final elements can participate in multiple combined output state hazard scenarios, in each Protective Instrument Loop Final Element, you will need to describe the hazardous events that are associated with that final element. In other words, describing the hazardous event in one Protective Instrument Loop Final Element will not populate the linked Protective Instrument Loop Final Element with the same description.
