Create an Instance in the Business Functional HierarchyYou can create new instances or child-instances for each level in the business functional hierarchy.About This Task
You can begin your creation of instances from a selection in the Context Browser. While in the process of creating an instance, it is possible to change to a different parent node and create a child-instance for that node.Important: After you have created an instance, you cannot modify the placement of the instance in the business functional hierarchy. For information on deleting an instance from a Business Functional Object, refer to  the Delete an Asset Instance section of the documentation, and begin again.
You can create instances in the business functional hierarchy as follows:Table 1. Available Classification InstancesBeginning from hereYou can create this type of instanceEnterpriseYou can create a child-Enterprise, or a Site.SiteYou can create a child-Site, a Segment, or an Asset.SegmentYou can create a child-Segment, or an Asset.AssetYou can create a child-Asset.

When you create a new instance, you must define the following:Table 2. Classification DefinitionsFieldDescriptionInstance nameThe name of the new instance.(Optional) DescriptionA description of the new instance.Source IDA unique identifier for a new instance.Note: You can assign the same source ID to different types of business functional hierarchy such as Enterprise, Site, Segment, and Asset in different cases.For example: TurbineSiteType (SiteType), turbinesitetype (AssetType), Turbinesitetype (SegmentType)Lifecycle StageYou can select a new lifecycle stage for the instance.StatusYou can select a new status for the instance.(Optional) Position in Hierarchy check boxCreates the new instance at the top level in the hierarchy. This disables the Parent Node context selection.Parent NodeAllows you to define the level in the hierarchy in which the instance is created as a child-node. Selecting  in the Parent Node box accesses the Context Browser, allowing you to select from the choices available in the hierarchy.Classification Type drop-downSpecifies the type of instance (Enterprise, Site, Segment, or Asset). If a type is not allowed for this instance, the selection is greyed out.Parent Classification drop-downThe specific classification associated with the instance. The Parent Classification is based on the Classification Type selected. If the Asset
Type is selected as a classification type, you can search for a classification.
