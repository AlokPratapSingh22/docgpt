Spares AnalysesAbout Spares Analysis Spares Analysis is a tool that helps you maintain the optimal number of spare parts. Spares Analysis uses delivery time and cost, downtime, lost production costs, and failure and repair data to calculate how many spare parts should be kept on hand at any given time.
GE Digital APM Reliability Analytics offers various tools that help you analyze the reliability of your equipment and locations so that you can make decisions about when to repair and replace those pieces of equipment and locations. For example, a Reliability Distribution Analysis lets you analyze historical failure data to help predict future failures. Based on those predictions, you can make plans for replacing equipment and making repairs to prevent future failures. As part of making plans to replace equipment in the future, you will want to make sure that you have an adequate number of spare parts available. Having spare parts on hand will help reduce the amount of downtime associated with unplanned failures.The key to a successful spares program is maintaining a balance between:Optimizing the spares level so that you have enough spare parts to handle unplanned failures.Not having a surplus of parts that are not actually needed.You can modify the input data for a Spares Analysis to evaluate the potential savings or losses associated with changing the spares level. For example, if you currently keep three spare seals for a pump, you could use a Spares Analysis to determine whether it would benefit your company financially to store either more or fewer spare seals instead.Access a Spares Analysis Procedure

What To Do Next


Create a Spare


Example of a Spares Analysis
This example of a Spares Analysis demonstrates how you can use Spares Analyses to evaluate spare parts. We will refer to this example throughout the Spares Analysis documentation as needed.
Assume that you want to create a Spares Analysis for a group of pumps, which contain seals, bearings, and impellers, each of which can fail. Because you may need to replace seals, bearings, and impellers on the pumps when they fail, you can use a Spares Analysis to determine the optimal level for each spare part. Currently, two spare seals, two spare bearings, and no spare impellers are stored in the warehouse. By conducting a Spares Analysis, you can determine if this number of spare parts is adequate.
In the Spares Analysis, you will include failure data for each part of the pump, run the Monte Carlo simulation, and then view the plots to see the optimal level of each spare part. By implementing the recommended spare level, you will be able to limit the amount of downtime and reduce failure costs.
The following records will be defined for the Spares Analysis example. Data that exists within each record in the Spares Analysis example can be found in the example data tables.

Spares Analysis Example (Spares Analysis record)
Seals (Spare record)
Inboard Application (Spare Application record)
Inboard Population 1 (Spare Application Population record)
Inboard Population 2 (Spare Application Population record)
Outboard Application (Spare Application record)
Outboard Population 1 (Spare Application Population record)
Outboard Population 2 (Spare Application Population record)
Outboard Population 3 (Spare Application Population record)
Bearings (Spare record)
Inboard Application (Spare Application record)
Inboard Population 1 (Spare Application Population record)
Inboard Population 2 (Spare Application Population record)
Outboard Application (Spare Application record)
Outboard Population 1 (Spare Application Population record)
Outboard Population 2 (Spare Application Population record)
Outboard Population 3 (Spare Application Population record)
Impellers (Spare record)
All Applications (Spare Application record)
Pump Population 1 (Spare Application Population record)
Pump Population 2 (Spare Application Population record)
Pump Population 3 (Spare Application Population record)
Pump Population 4 (Spare Application Population record)
When viewing this list of records, you can see that each Spare record is linked to the Spares Analysis record, each Spare Application record is linked to a Spare record, and each Spare Application Population record is linked to a Spare Application record.
This example represents only one approach to creating a Spares Analysis. There are many alternate workflows that can be used for developing a Spares Analysis. For example, instead of creating a Spares Analysis at the pump level (e.g., the equipment level), you can create a Spares Analysis for each of the individual spare parts. After you are familiar with the functionality of a Spares Analysis, you can implement any workflow that works best for your organization.
