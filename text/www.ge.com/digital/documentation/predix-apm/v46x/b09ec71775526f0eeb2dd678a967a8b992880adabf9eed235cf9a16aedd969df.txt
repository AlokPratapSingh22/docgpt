Confidence Level and P Value







Confidence Level and P ValueAbout Confidence Level and P-ValueIn a Distribution Analysis, the Confidence Level and the P-Value are used to determine whether the data passes the Goodness of Fit test.The Confidence Level indicates the percentage of uncertainty of the Goodness of Fit method. This percentage is usually determined by experience or an industry standard and limits how closely the data must fit the model in order for it to pass the Goodness of Fit test. The higher the Confidence Level, the farther apart your confidence bounds will be, and the easier it will be for your data to pass the Goodness of Fit test. The lower the Confidence Level and the closer together the bounds are, the harder it will be for your data to pass the Goodness of Fit test. If the data does pass, however, the data will be a very close fit to the model.Note: When you enter a Confidence Level, you must specify a value that is greater than one (1) but less than one hundred (100).About Data Censoring in a Reliability Distribution AnalysisReliability Distribution Analysis supports the functionality of censoring, which accounts for the period of time from the last failure date to the analysis end date. You can censor or ignore datapoints in a Reliability Distribution Analysis to estimate the probability of when a failure might occur. Censoring is based on failure modes. Details
Censoring a datapoint means that the datapoint is excluded as a failure but included in the operating time of the piece of equipment. If you select the Censored check box, the data in the selected row is excluded. When you create a Reliability Distribution Analysis using a query or dataset as the data source, the GE Digital APM system automatically censors time values from the beginning of the Analysis Period to the first event and the time value from the last event to the end of the analysis. After the calculations for the analysis have been performed, each time that the query or dataset is refreshed, the censoring settings will be reset using the default criteria. Therefore, if you select a check box and refresh the data, the check boxes will no longer be selected.
Regardless of the data source you use, you can censor any failure data. Consider the following:
For Maximum Likelihood Estimators (MLE), the maximum number of censored datapoints is one (1) less than the total number of datapoints.For Least Squares estimation, the maximum number of censored datapoints is two (2) less than the total number of datapoints.
Pump Failure
Assume that you want to determine the reasons due to which a pump failed. 
A pump might have failed due to multiple reasons, such as rusted part, motor overheating, insufficient power supply, or power outage. Each of these reasons will have its own specific failure rate and probability density function. To determine the failure rate of "motor overheating", you must censor all other failure modes from the analysis. 
Further, motor overheating might be caused due to multiple reasons, such as improper operation, improper application, and improper maintenance. The censoring feature allows you to separate the failure modes, and determine which is the dominant failure mode. Based on this information, you can decide what is needed to improve the motor performance. 
Auto-Censoring
When you first create a Reliability Distribution Analysis, an automatically censored datapoint for each defined asset will appear on the plot. Each automatically censored datapoint represents the analysis End Date (specified on the 
Set Analysis Period window) for each defined asset.

GE Digital APM can:
Censor failures automatically when it cannot calculate the time between events. For example, failure on a specific asset where the analysis does not contain a start date. Alert you that a datapoint is suspect. For example, in a Time to Failure type of distribution, an alert will be generated when the start date of an event overlaps the end date of a different event for the same asset. For this asset, suspect data is displayed in the Analysis Summary workspace.
Note: Although automatically censored datapoints appear on the plots, they do not appear in the 
Failures
 grid and, therefore, cannot be uncensored.
For a Reliability Distribution Analysis, when you pause on an automatically censored datapoint, the following information appears:
 Auto-Censored  Name: Specified on the 
Assets tab of the Reliability Distribution Data Editor window. Installation Date: Specified in the 
Assets section of the Reliability Distribution Data Editor window. TTF value: Represents the time between the last failure date and the analysis End Date.
Modify the Confidence Level for a Reliability Distribution AnalysisAbout This Task
The Confidence Level specifies how the optimistic and realistic scenarios will be selected in a Monte Carlo Simulation for TTR Distributions in an analysis. The Confidence Level indicates whether the distribution is within the confidence limits or not. The default Confidence Level for an analysis is 90 percent.
You can modify the Confidence Level in the Analysis Summary workspace or after selecting any of the plot tabs in the left pane.

Choose the Time Units for an AnalysisAbout This Task
The time units are used for expressing time values for calculations performed within an analysis. For example, a calculation may indicate the amount of time that lapsed between a failure event and the end date of the analysis period. This value would be expressed in the Time Units for the analysis.
Your Time Units selection will depend on what type of data you are using and what type of analysis you are performing. For example, in an analysis that shows the distribution of failures for a number of pieces of equipment or locations over many years, years might be an appropriate unit of time. For an analysis designed to evaluate failures for a single piece of equipment or location within a very specific time period, a smaller unit of time would be appropriate. For this reason, you can choose the Time Units that are most appropriate for a given analysis.
Note: Downtime for TTF calculations should always be provided using days. When the failure data contains downtime, the system selects Days by default.
Procedure
Access a Reliability Distribution Analysis for which you want to modify the Time Units.In the left pane, select the Probability Plot tab. 
The Probability Plot appears in the workspace.

Additionally, any record returned by the query will not be updated with your changes. The changes will be saved to the analysis only.After you modify the data and save the analysis, the modified data will appear each time you open the analysis. If you want to revert to the original data, you can reload the original data to the analysis. In addition, if a query or dataset has changed in the database, you can reload the original data to the analysis in order for your analysis to contain those changes.

Reload Analysis Data in a Reliability Distribution AnalysisAbout This Task
When you create and save an analysis that is based on a query or dataset, the GE Digital APM system takes a snapshot of the data that exists at the time of creation and saves it along with the analysis. When you open an existing analysis, the GE Digital APM system loads the data that was last saved with the analysis. This means that any changes to the underlying query or dataset will not be reflected automatically when you open an existing analysis.
Note: If the query or dataset has been deleted or renamed, when you try to open an associated analysis, an error message will appear, and the data will not be refreshed.
If you want to refresh an analysis based on changes to the underlying query or dataset or to load new data that has been added since the analysis was last saved (e.g., the analysis is based on a query that retrieves failures for a piece of equipment or location, and a new failure record has been added to the database), you will need to reload the analysis manually after opening it. When you reload the data, any manual changes made to the analysis data set will be deleted.
Note: Reloading analysis data resets the analysis period only if it is based on the analysis data. Start Dates and End Dates that have been set explicitly will not be overwritten.
Procedure
Access a Reliability Distribution Analysis for which you want to reload the data.In the left pane, select Probability Plot.

Planned Cost: The planned maintenance cost you entered on the Preventative Maintenance Optimization window.
Unplanned Cost: The unplanned maintenance cost you entered on the Preventative Maintenance Optimization window.
Optimal Preventative Maintenance Interval: The optimum interval during which you should perform maintenance on the piece of equipment you are analyzing.
Estimated Maintenance Cost: The estimated maintenance cost per day for each piece of equipment during the optimal PM interval.
Optimal Value inflection point: A value identified on the total cost curve.
About Preventive Maintenance Optimization
Preventative Maintenance (PM) Optimization uses the results of a Reliability Distribution Analysis to measure the optimum time to perform a Planned (Restorative) Maintenance (PM) procedure on a piece of equipment. PM optimization does not calculate minor maintenance schedules but determines the optimal time to perform major repairs or replace a piece of equipment until there is a minimal amount of cost and risk. PM optimization is only valid for wear-out failure modes and will not give accurate results for a Weibull analysis where Beta is less than 1.



Note: Interaction with graphs is not available on touch-screen devices.
Details
A PM optimization is composed of the following steps:
The calculation model is configured to acquire the necessary parameters, including Mean Time Between Failures (MTBF). MTBF is used to determine the probability that a piece of equipment will fail.The cost ratio is determined. This ratio is the cost of planned Preventative Maintenance (PM) events versus the cost of unplanned maintenance events. You can manually enter the cost or select an existing query as the source of the cost data.Based on the MTBF and the calculation of the ratios, the GE Digital APM system estimates the optimum time (interval) to maintain equipment. The cost per piece of equipment based on the Optimized Preventative Maintenance Interval is also displayed.The GE Digital APM system creates optimization graphs, which gives the analyst the optimum time to conduct a repair or overhaul based upon the ratio of planned to unplanned repair costs. This ensures that repairs are conducted in a cost-effective manner, minimizing risk while maximizing time in service.
The limitation to using a PM optimization is it will always give a result for the statistical distribution on which it is based. This does not mean that it will always make sense to do a PM at the interval specified. In particular, design flaws that manifest themselves as poor reliability can more effectively be addressed through redesign rather than PM.
