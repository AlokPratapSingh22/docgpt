Asset Restrictions OverviewAbout Asset RestrictionsUse Asset Restrictions to restrict users or user groups from viewing the decommissioned assets.If a user is given permission to an Enterprise, Site, or Segment, the user can access all the assets including the decommissioned assets within the Enterprise, Site, or Segment. The tenant administrators or a user with Asset fine-grained permissions in the tenant can restrict the users to access the assets in the decommissioned state.A Restriction Policy table listing restrictions policies and their descriptions is included. Selecting a link from the table opens the Restrictions page for the selected policy. Metadata associated to the selected policy populates the applicability, attribute, action, and attribute value information on the Restrictions page. In the User / User Group Selection section on the Restrictions page, you can toggle between User Groups and Users. Once you have selected User Groups or User, the relevant table displaying members that have the selected policy applied appears. You can add new members, remove members, and search for members in this section. You can add members to the selected policy singly, or in bulk. Members are validated and confirmed when you add them.The default settings for asset restrictions is the selected asset access is restricted.Tip: If you have decommissioned an asset, you cannot recommission it using ingestion.
