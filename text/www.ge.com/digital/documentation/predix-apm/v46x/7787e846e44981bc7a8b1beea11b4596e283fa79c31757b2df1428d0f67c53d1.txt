The following table describes the graph types that are supported by GE Digital APM.

Graph Type

Button

Useful For...
Bar GraphsStacked Column

Comparing a set or series of values to the same scale, unit of comparison, or range of time. The information on a bar graph is represented by vertical or horizontal bars.Stacked Bar

Clustered Column

Clustered Bar

Color Scale GraphLine GraphsLine

Identifying trends by comparing a series of values. The data that is displayed on a line graph is represented by a line whose peaks and crevices indicate changes in the data.Area

Identifying trends by tracking a series of values measured against a set scale. The information in an area graph is displayed in linear form.Stacked Area

Identifying trends by tracking a series of values measured over time or other category data. The information in a stacked area graph is displayed in linear form.Pie GraphPie

Comparing a portion of the data to the whole. For example, you could use the pie graph to determine the percentage of energy that is used by a particular piece of equipment or group of equipment.Doughnut

Comparing portions of the data to one another. For example, you could use a doughnut graph to determine which manufacturer's centrifugal pumps are most active.Pyramid

Displaying hierarchical structure of data. For example, you could use a pyramid graph to display the contributing factors to a failure arranged in the order of magnitude.Radar GraphRadar

Displaying multi-source values as they relate to one another. For example, you could use a radar graph to compare your allocated versus budgeted spending, where you can also view the level of spending per expense category (e.g., marketing and salaries). The data in a radar graph is displayed in a plot that resembles a spiderweb.Filled Radar

Scatter PlotsScatter

Comparing a series of x and y coordinates, and identifying relationships between values in an x, y coordinate. For example, you could use a scatter plot to view the cost of repair by failure date for a group of equipment. Bubble

Comparing a series of x and y values with z sizes, and identifying relationships between values of different sizes in an x, y coordinate. For example, you could use a bubble plot to view the cost of repair by failure date for a group of equipment, where the bubble marker size is determined by the criticality indicator for each piece of equipment in the group.Stock GraphsLine

Comparing the trend of a particular value over time. For example, you could use a line graph to plot the cost of repair for the past four years. The graph helps you visualize how the cost of repair has been increasing or decreasing over time.Area

Stacked Area

Comparing the trend of multiple values over time. For example, you could use a stacked line graph to plot the cost of repair and the cost of operator training for the past four years. The graph helps you visualize if the increase in the cost of operator training leads to a decrease in the cost of repair.Heat Map GraphsHeat Map

Displays data using a range of colors to give an immediate visual summary of values to identify trends and potential problems.

About Graph Dimensions
The Data Source workspace displays a list of the columns or fields that exist in the underlying query or dataset. The graph dimensions will adjust automatically based on your settings.
Suppose you have a query with the following results:
Equipment Technical NumberTotal CostMaintenance CostG0010A-0741690651386387G0003-0921341803228380G0010B-0741166331312371GC0030-0911046865175728G0016-092975146369122
A graph that you build from this query could display the Bad Actors by total cost, as shown in the following image:



...or both total cost and maintenance cost for each asset, as shown in the following image.



Specify the Graph DimensionsBefore You Begin

Select a data source.
Procedure
Access the graph for which you want to specify the graph dimensions.In the left pane, select Dimension Mapping.
The Dimension Mapping workspace appears.



Note:  If you are mapping the dimensions for a heat map or color scale graph, you will be mapping columns instead of a series.
In the Vertical Axis Values section, select Map Series.
The Dimension for Series window appears.

Note: If you are creating a color scale graph, the Vertical Axis Value must be taken from the query column that returns the name of the color displayed on the color scale. The logic for determining the color for each row of query results should be embedded in the query itself using any valid HTML color name or code. For example, the following query determines colors based upon the value of another column: SELECT [MC_MTCRD].[MC_MTCRD_TIME_STAMP_D] "Timestamp" 
, Decode([MC_MTCRD].[MC_MTCRD_VALUE_C], 'RUNNING', Green', 'INFEEDHOLD', 'Yellow', 'DOWNLOADING', 'Yellow', 'ABORTED', 'Red', 'Orange') "Color" 
FROM [MC_MTCRD] ORDER BY [MC_MTCRD].[MC_MTCRD_TIME_STAMP_D] Asc 

Select the dimensions that you want to plot on the vertical axis, and then select Apply.
The selected dimensions appear in the Vertical Axis Values section.
In the Category section, select Map Category.
The Dimension for Category window appears.Note: If you are creating a time series graph, the Dimension for Category must be time stamp.

Select a data source for the graph.
Procedure
Access the graph whose query or dataset you want to access.In the upper-left corner of the Graph Result workspace, select .
The query or dataset appears.
Refresh a GraphAbout This Task
You can refresh a graph to ensure that the graph is displaying the most recent database information and configuration options. For example, you might want to refresh the graph to rerun the associated query, or to see the effect of adding a record to the database.
Note:  If the underlying query contains a prompt, the prompt will be displayed after you refresh the graph. You will need to provide the prompt values after refreshing.
Procedure
Access the graph that you want to refresh.In the upper-left corner of the Graph Result workspace, select .
The graph refreshes to display the most recent information.
About Hyperlinks on Graphs
You can add hyperlinks to a graph to access any GE Digital APMÂ module addressable via a URL or an external website. When a hyperlink has been added to a graph, selecting a datapoint on the graph will display the location defined for the link.
Note:  If you add a hyperlink to a pie, doughnut, or a pyramid graph, the URLÂ will not trigger when you select a datapoint on the graph.
Note: You can enable hyperlinks when the Category column is in the first column by selecting the check box in the Settings UI on the Series tab.
When you add a hyperlink to a graph, you can configure it such that when you select a datapoint on the graph, a specific value from the graph will be passed in as a parameter value to the URL. You can pass any of the following values into the URL:
The vertical value of the selected datapointThe x-axis value of the selected datapointThe value stored in a specific field in the record associated with the selected datapointThe Family Key of the record associated with the selected datapointThe Entity Key of the record associated with the selected datapointAll the values for any previously accessed graph
Add a Hyperlink to a GraphBefore You Begin

About the Vertical Axis Scales
When you choose a column or field to be plotted on the y-axis, you must specify the side of the graph on which the axis will appear: left or right. You can do so using the options that are available in the Dimension Mapping workspace.
If you choose to plot more than one column or field on the y-axis and the values in those columns or fields vary greatly, using a right and left y-axis can improve the usability of the graph.
Suppose you have a graph with the following underlying data:
Equipment Technical NumberTotal CostMaintenance CostProduction Losses G0010A-07416906513863871304264G0003-09213418032283801113423G0010B-0741166331312371853960GC0030-0911046865175728871137G0016-092975146369122606024
 In this example, if we plot a graph with multiple vertical axis values, it allows you to compare total cost, maintenance cost, and production loss, which provides a fuller picture of your assets.
