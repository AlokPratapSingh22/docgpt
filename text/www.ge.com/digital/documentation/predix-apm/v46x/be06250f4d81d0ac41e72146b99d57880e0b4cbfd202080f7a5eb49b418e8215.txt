General ReferenceGAA Data Model
The following diagram shows how the families used in GAA are related to one another. 



Note: In the diagram, boxes represent entity families and arrows represent relationship families that are configured in the baseline database. You can determine the direction of the each relationship definition from the direction of the arrowhead: the box from which the arrow originates is the predecessor, and the box to which the arrowhead points is the successor.
In addition to the families shown in the GAA data model, the following additional families are used for GAA reference:
Amplification CodesCause CodesGAA Code MappingGAA Event CategoriesGAA Event TransitionGAA Event TypesGAA Fuel TypesGAA Supported OrganizationsGAA Unit Types
GAA Security Groups

The following table lists the baseline Security Groups available for users within this module, as well as the baseline Roles to which those Security Groups are assigned. In Predix APM, Roles are assigned to Security Users through permission sets.

Important:  Assigning a Security User to a Role grants that user the privileges associated with all of the Security Groups that are assigned to that Role. To avoid granting a Security User unintended privileges, before assigning a Security User to a Role, be sure to review all of the privileges associated with the Security Groups assigned to that Role.

GAA State Management for Primary Events
When you are working with Primary Event records, you can use state management to facilitate a workflow that tracks the progress of the events. When you access a Primary Event, options appear that you can use to manage the states for Primary Events. You can follow the standard procedure for managing record states. The following baseline record states are configured for the Primary Event family:New: Indicates that a new Primary Event is created. You can modify or delete a Primary Event that is in this state.In Progress: Indicates that the Primary Event is ready to be proposed to the supervisor. You can modify or delete a Primary Event that is in this state.Pending Review: Indicates that the Primary Event needs to be reviewed. You can modify or delete a Primary Event that is in this state.Reviewed: Indicates that the Primary Event has been reviewed and is awaiting Unit approval. You can modify or delete a Primary Event that is in this state.Unit Approved: Indicates that all the data in a GAA Unit associated with the Primary Event has been approved. You can modify or delete a Primary Event that is in this state.Approved: Indicates that the Primary Event has been approved and is ready to be submitted to NERC. After the state of a Primary Event is changed to Approved, you cannot modify or delete the Primary Event.

GAA Site Filtering
Site filtering in GAA is achieved by specifying a Site Reference Key for a record. Users must have privileges for the relevant site to access records for the specified site. Users can be assigned to one or many sites. They will be able to see only the records that are assigned to their site(s) or that are global records.
Site filtering is enabled for the following families:

Contributing Event: A new Contributing Event record will inherit the site from the associated Primary Event and GAA Unit. After a Contributing Event record is created, you cannot modify the site assigned to the Contributing Event record.
GAA Company: You can assign any site to GAA Company record from the available sites. After you save the changes, you cannot modify the site.
GAA Performance: A new Performance record will inherit the site from the associated GAA Unit. After a Performance record is created, you cannot modify the site assigned to a Performance record.
GAA Plant: You can assign any site to GAA Plant from the available sites. This site could be different than the site assigned to a GAA Company record. After you save the changes, you cannot modify the site.
GAA Report Details: A new record will inherit the site from the associated GAA Unit. After a record is created, you cannot modify the site assigned to the record.
GAA Unit: You can assign any site to GAA Unit from the available sites. This site could be different than the site assigned to a GAA Company record or a GAA Plant record. After you save the changes, you cannot modify the site.
GAA Unit Capacity: A new Unit Capacity record will inherit the site from the associated GAA Unit. After a Unit Capacity record is created, you cannot modify the site assigned to the Unit Capacity record.
Primary Event: A new Primary Event record will inherit the site from the associated GAA Unit. After a Primary Event record is created, you cannot modify the site assigned to the Primary Event record. 
Primary Event History: The information that appears on the Revision History page will inherit the site from the associated GAA Unit.
Primary Event Details: The information that appears in the Unit Summary workspace will inherit the site from the associated GAA Unit. 
Reference Document: A new Regulatory Report record will inherit the site from the associated GAA Unit. After a record is created, you cannot modify the site assigned to the record.
Site filtering is not enabled for the following families. The records in these families are considered as Global records.
GAA ConfigurationAmplification Code Cause Code GAA Fuel Types

Consider an organization that has three sites, Site X, Site Y, and Site Z and contains the following records:
Event 1: Assigned to Site XEvent 2: Assigned to Site YEvent 3: Assigned to Site Z

Scenario 1: User assigned to only Site X

When this user accesses the GAA Overview page, the user will be able to see the records that are assigned to Site X:
Event 1: Assigned to Site X

Scenario 2: User assigned to both Site X and Site Y

When this user accesses the GAA Overview page, the user will be able to see the records that are assigned to Site X and Site Y:
Event 1: Assigned to Site X
Event 2: Assigned to Site Y

Scenario 3: Super User

When this user accesses the summary of a GAA Unit, the user will be able to see the records that are assigned to any of the sites:
