System Reliability Analyses About System Reliability AnalysisSystem Reliability is a feature of GE Digital APM Reliability Analytics that allows you to model different system scenarios (often referred to as RAM, i.e., Reliability, Availability, and Modelling) and then run Monte Carlo simulations to simulate the behavior of the system so that you can predict the cost and reliability of the system and its elements.System Reliability can be a useful tool in various situations:When you are constructing a new system, you can use a System Reliability Analysis to model various options for the construction of the system and then choose the option that is the most reliable and cost-effective.For existing systems, you can use a System Reliability Analysis to evaluate how the system could be modified to increase reliability and production output.Using a System Reliability Analysis, you can:Estimate the overall reliability and cost of a system, including the estimated reliability for each of the included pieces of equipment and locations.Use equipment and location information that is already stored in the database or create new equipment and locations to use in the analysis.Add maintenance and downtime to the system and recalculate the effects of additions.View a graphical summary of the cost and reliability predictions for a system.Model different scenarios to compare reliability and cost across multiple systems.Access a System Reliability AnalysisProcedure

About Components in a System Reliability Analysis
A System Reliability Analysis is made up of records and links as defined by the System Reliability data model. At a conceptual level, groups of records and links make up the main elements of the analysis, as defined in the following list:

 System Reliability analysis : A collection of Scenarios, Resources, and simulation results that make up a given analysis. A System Reliability Analysis is represented by a System analysis record, which stores identifying information about the analysis and is linked to other records that make up the analysis.

 Scenario : A representation of one design option for a given system. A Scenario is represented by a System Scenario record, which contains all the identifying information for the Scenario and is linked to other records that help define the Scenario. Each Scenario can contain the following components:


 Diagram : A logical, visual representation of the physical structure of a system, including all the elements in the system and the connections between them. A Diagram might be the representation of a system as it physically exists at your work site, or it might represent a variation of a physical system developed for the purpose of analyzing how changes to the system could impact maintenance and production costs. Each Scenario contains one Diagram.
A Diagram is represented by a System Subsystem record, which can be linked to System Subsystem, System Sensor, System Buffer, System Link, System Asset, and System Switch records. The items that these records represent are referred to as elements, which are simply the components that make up the Diagram itself.

 Risk : A component that identifies a specific way that a piece of equipment or location can fail and specifies the consequences of the failure and includes Time to Failure (TTF) and Time to Repair (TTR) distribution data. A Risk is represented by a System Risk record, which contains all of the identifying information for the Risk.
 Action : A component that identifies a specific operation that can be performed against a piece of equipment or location. Actions include condition-based maintenance, procedures, redesigns, time-based maintenance, and training, and may or may not mitigate Risks. Actions are represented by records in the System Condition Monitor, System Inspection, System Preventive Maintenance, or System Special Action families, which contain all the identifying information for the Action.
 Global Event : A component that groups together Actions that require a system shutdown. Scheduling a Global Event can make a system more efficient by providing more time in which to run the system while still allowing maintenance and other Actions to take place. A Global Event is represented by a System Global Event record, which contains all the identifying information for the Global Event.
 Resource: A component of a System Reliability Analysis that associates a cost with an occurrence of an Action or Risk. Resources are defined for a System Reliability Analysis and are represented by a System Resource record.
 Simulation Results : The outcome of running a simulation against all Scenarios included in a given System Reliability Analysis. Simulation results are stored in System Element Result, System Action Result, or System Resource Result records, which are linked to the root System analysis record.
Example of a System Reliability Analysis
This topic provides an example of a System Reliability Analysis. This example will be referred to as necessary throughout the System Reliability Analysis documentation.
This System Reliability Analysis example involves a water bottling facility, which contains a system that performs the following steps in the water bottling process:
Collects water from a source via a pump.Runs the water through a bottling subsystem, which fills bottles and attaches caps and labels to the bottles.
Note: In this example, we assume that the bottles, labels, and caps are produced at a separate facility and utilized in this process.
For our example, we will use three different scenarios to evaluate the reliability and cost associated with three different models for this system:
Scenario A
Diagram
Scenario A represents the current structure of the system as shown in the following image. 



The physical model for Scenario A includes the following components:

Water Source: Produces water that can be used in the water bottling process. For our example, we will assume that the Water Source is a naturally occurring spring. This component is represented by an Asset element in the Diagram for Scenario A.
Water Pump: Pulls water from the Water Source and into the Buffer. This component is represented by an Asset element in the Diagram for Scenario A.
Water Tank: Stores water and feeds it into the Bottling Subsystem. This component is represented by a Buffer element in the Diagram for Scenario A.
Bottling Subsystem: Fills bottles and attaches labels and caps. This subsystem is comprised of three Asset elements (Bottling Line 1, Bottling Line 2, and Bottling Line 3) and a Link. This component is represented by a Subsystem element in the Diagram for Scenario A.
Link: Combines and manages the production of the Bottling Lines within the Bottling Subsystem. The Link specifies that two of the three Bottling Lines must be running for the entire Subsystem to run. This component is represented by a Link in the Diagram for Scenario A.
Risks
When the Water Pump element fails due to a risk, the entire system will fail and accrue lost production costs. The following risks are assigned to the Water Pump element in Scenario A:
Seal Failure.Bearing Failure.Impeller Failure.
Every time the Water Pump experiences an unplanned Bearing Failure, the correction will require the use of the Bearing, Mechanic, and Seal Resources. If the Water Pump requires a bearing replacement as the result of a planned correction, only the Bearing and Mechanic Resources will be needed. Therefore, the following Resources have been assigned to the Bearing Failure Risk:

Unplanned Resources: Mechanic, Bearings, and Seal.
Planned Resources: Mechanic and Bearings.
Actions
There are no actions defined for Scenario A.
Scenario B
Diagram
Scenario B represents the current structure of the system as shown in the following image. 



The physical model for Scenario B is shown in this image. It is identical to Scenario A, but Actions and additional Resources have been assigned to the Water Pump in this Scenario to mitigate Risks.
Risks
The same Risks are defined for Scenario B as are defined for Scenario A. The same Resources are assigned to these Risks.
Actions
For Scenario B, the following Actions have been defined for the Water Pump:

Replace Seal: A time-based maintenance Action that mitigates the Seal Failure Risk.
Vibration Analysis: An inspection or periodic condition-based maintenance Action that mitigates the Bearing Failure Risk. The Vibration Technician Resource has been assigned to the Vibration Analysis Action.
Redesign Impeller: A redesign Action that mitigates the Impeller Failure Risk.
Scenario C
Diagram
Scenario C represents the current structure of the system as shown in the following image. 



The physical model for Scenario C is shown in this image. It is similar to Scenario A but contains the following additional components:

Water Pump 2: Pulls water from the Water Source and into the Water Tank. Water Pump 2 serves as a backup or standby for Water Pump 1 and is represented by an Asset element in the Diagram for Scenario C.
Sensor 1: Monitors Water Pump 1 for failure. When Water Pump 1 fails, Sensor 1 activates Switch 2, indicating that Water Pump 2 will start running, and deactivates Switch 1 to indicate that Water Pump 1 has stopped running. Sensor 1 is represented by a Sensor element in the Diagram for Scenario C.
Sensor 2: Monitors Water Pump 2 for failure. When Water Pump 1 fails, Water Pump 2 will start running and will continue to run until it fails. When Water Pump 2 fails, Sensor 2 will activate Switch 1, indicating that Pump 1 is running, and will deactivate Switch 2 to indicate that Water Pump 2 has stopped running. Sensor 2 is represented by a Sensor element in the Diagram for Scenario C.
Switch 1: Is initially set to On, indicating that Water Pump 1 is initially running. When activated by Sensor 1, connects the Water Source and Water Pump 1 so that Pump 1 will feed water into the Water Tank. When deactivated by Sensor 1, Switch 1 disconnects Water Source and Water Pump 1. Switch 1 is represented by a Switch element in the Diagram for Scenario C.
Switch 2: Is initially set to Off, indicating that Pump 2 is not running initially. When activated by Sensor 2, connects the Water Source and Water Pump 2 so that Pump 2 will feed water into the Water Tank. When deactivated by Sensor 2, Switch 2 disconnects Water Source and Water Pump 2. Switch 2 is represented by a Switch element in the Diagram for Scenario C.
Risks
The same Risks are defined for Scenario C as are defined for Scenarios A and B. The same Resources are assigned to these Risks.
Actions
There are no Actions defined for Scenario C.

In addition to these scenarios, we will define the following resources for our example:

Bearing: A replacement bearing.
Seal: A replacement seal.
Mechanic: A mechanic who will perform needed maintenance.
Vibration Technician: A professional who will perform vibration analysis.
Redesign Impeller: A redesign action that mitigates the Impeller Failure Risk.
Conclusions
By comparing Scenario A, Scenario B, and Scenario C, we will be able to view each scenario's reliability and cost and identify the scenario that has the highest reliability and lowest cost associated with it. Scenario A represents the current design, and both Scenario B and Scenario C represent modifications to the original design. These modifications support different hypotheses about modifying our current system:
Scenario B proposes that by implementing certain Actions that mitigate Risks associated with the Water Pump, we may be able to increase the reliability and decrease the cost of the system.Scenario C proposes that by introducing an additional Water Pump, which will prevent a full system failure when Water Pump 1 fails, we may be able to increase the reliability and decrease the cost of the system.
By modeling and comparing the three different Scenarios, we should be able to draw conclusions and make recommendations about changes that should be implemented to improve the reliability of the system.
This is a simple example and is limited to three scenarios only. As you develop a System Reliability Analysis, you may want to develop additional scenarios that model other variations to the system. As we continue to use this example throughout the System Reliability documentation, we will provide suggestions for where you might modify or extend our example to take advantage of the System Reliability features to create a more complex, in-depth analysis.
