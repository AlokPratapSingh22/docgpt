Data LoadersAbout the GAA Data LoadersGAA provides three data loaders.  Generation Availability Analysis (GAA) Amplification Codes Data LoaderThis data loader allows you to import the latest Amplification Codes to the GE Digital APM system to populate the Amplification Codes family.  Generation Availability Analysis (GAA) Cause Codes Data LoaderThis data loader allows you to import the latest Cause Codes to the GE Digital APM system to populate the Cause Codes family.
Generation Availability Analysis (GAA) Events Data LoaderThis data loader allows you to import the primary, related, and contributing Events to GE Digital APM.
About the GAA Data Loaders RequirementsTo use the GAA Amplification Codes Data Loader, GAA Cause Codes Data Loader, and GAA Events Data Loader, your organization must have completed the deployment of the Generation Availability Analysis module.Security Settings
The Security User performing the data load operation must be associated with either the MI Data Loader User or MI Data Loader Admin Security Role, and must also be associated with the MI GAA Administrator Security Group or a Security Role that is associated with this Security Group.
About the GAA Data Loaders General Loading StrategyImportant:  When importing Amplification and Cause Codes using the GAA Data Loaders, you must ensure that the latest Amplification and Cause Codes from the corresponding documentation is used.Limitations
This section documents a list of the limitations for the GAA Data Loaders:
You must use the GAA Amplification Codes Data Loader workbook (Generation Availability Analysis (GAA) Amplification Codes.xlsx), GAA Cause Codes Data Loader workbook (Generation Availability Analysis (GAA) Cause Code.xlsx), and GAA Events Data Loader workbook (Generation Availability Analysis (GAA) Events.xlsx. Any modifications made by the user to the values in column headings in any of the worksheets will not be imported.Note:  Any column values in a customized format will not be imported by the GAA Amplification Codes Data Loader and the GAA Cause Codes Data Loader.If the user imports the same data multiple times, the most recently imported data is included in the database. If a record currently resides in the database and is then reimported, the newly imported file will replace the existing file in the database. The GAA Data Loader does not append the existing record. 
Recommendations
While using the GAA Events Data Loader, we recommend that you:Include the primary event and its related and contributing events in the same batch.Process only up to 100 records in a batch.Modify only the fields that are editable from the GE Digital APM application.
About the GAA Data Loaders Workbook Layout and Use
To import Amplification codes, Cause codes, and Events, GE Digital APM provides the GAA Amplification Codes Data Loader workbook (Generation Availability Analysis (GAA) Amplification Codes.xlsx), GAA Cause Codes Data Loader workbook (Generation Availability Analysis (GAA) Cause Code.xlsx), and GAA Events Data Loader workbook (Generation Availability Analysis (GAA) Events.xlsx). These workbooks support baseline GAA in GE Digital APM. You must use these workbooks to load Amplification Codes, Cause Codes, and Events, respectively. 
Tip: You can download the GAA Events data loader template from either the Download Templates window of the APM Power Generation category or by selecting the Export button () in the Events section of the Units Summary workspace.
GAA Amplification Codes Data Loader
The following table lists the worksheets that are included in the Generation Availability Analysis (GAA) Amplification Codes.xlsx workbook:

WorksheetDescriptionConfiguration Worksheet 
The Configuration worksheet is needed to describe the type of data that you will be loading and how that data should be handled during the data load.
AmplificationCodes Worksheet 
The AmplificationCodes Worksheet is used to import the latest Amplification Codes to the GE Digital APM system to populate the Amplification Code family.


Configuration Worksheet

Field CaptionField IDData Type (Length)CommentsData Worksheet ID DATA_WORKSHEET_ID Character This column contains the name of the <data> worksheet where the actual data is located. It needs to have the same name as the <data> worksheet in the data loader workbook.Batch SizeBATCH_SIZECharacter 
Modifying this field is required to determine the number of records processed in each batch. Enter the batch size you want, and the Data Loader will process that many records per batch.
For example, if you want to use a batch size of 100, enter 100, and the data loader will process 100 records per batch. 
Note:  The recommended batch size is 100. If the Batch Size column is removed from the source workbook, the data loader will default to a batch size of 100. 
In addition to processing the data in batches, the log file reports progress by batch. 
Primary Family IDPRIMARY_FAMILY_ID Character
Depending on the type of data that you are working with, this will contain the Relationship Family ID or the Entity Family ID. You can also allow the data in source file to determine the Family ID by encapsulating the Field ID that contains the Family ID data in brackets (<>). 
For example, if in the <data> worksheet, there exists a column with the ID of PRIMARY_FAMILY_ID, where each row contains the corresponding Family ID, then in this column, you should put the value of <PRIMARY_FAMILY_ID>. 
If the Family ID in the GE Digital APM metadata contains spaces, then you must use this feature.
Primary Family Key Fields PRIMARY_FAMILY_KEY_FIELDS Character
This column contains the Field IDs associated with the Primary Family that are used to uniquely identify a record. If more than one field is to be used, then each Field ID needs to be separated by a | (Pipe) character. In the case where you are loading data into a relationship, if no keys fields exist or are used, use the <none> constant. 
If the Primary Action is ACTION_INSERTONLY, then no key fields need to be specified, so you can use the <none> constant.
Family Type FAMILY_TYPE CharacterThe value is this column should be Entity or Relationship depending on the type of data that is being loaded.Predecessor Family ID PRED_FAMILY_ID CharacterWhen the Family Type is Relationship, this column will contain the value of the Entity Family ID that is the predecessor in the relationship. Otherwise, it should contain the <none> constant. You can also use the data in each of the rows to determine the Predecessor Family ID. Predecessor Family Key Fields PRED_FAMILY_KEY_FIELDS Character
This column contains the Field ID or IDs associated with the Predecessor Family that are used to uniquely identify the predecessor record. If more than one field is to be used, then each Field ID needs to be separated by a | (Pipe) character. 
If the Predecessor Action is ACTION_INSERTONLY, then no key fields need to be specified, so you can use the <none> constant.
Successor Family ID SUCC_FAMILY_ID CharacterWhen the Family Type is Relationship, this column will contain the value of the Entity Family ID that is the successor in the relationship. Otherwise, it should contain the <none> constant. You can also use the data in each of the rows to determine the Successor Family ID. Successor Family Key Fields SUCC_FAMILY_KEY_FIELDS Character
This column contains the Field ID or IDs associated with the Successor Family that are used to uniquely identify the successor record. If more than one field is to be used, then each Field ID needs to be separated by a | (Pipe) character. 
If the Successor Action is ACTION_INSERTONLY, then no key fields need to be specified, so you can use the <none> constant. 
Primary Action PRIMARY_ACTION Character
The value in this column will determine the action that will be applied to the Primary Family records. If the Family Type is Entity, then the possible values are: 
ACTION_INSERTONLYACTION_INSERTUPDATE ACTION_UPDATEONLY ACTION_DELETE ACTION_PURGE 
Deleting a record and purging a record will both delete the current record, the difference being that the purge action will delete the record and all of the links or relationships tied to that record. The delete action will simply attempt to delete the record, and if it is related to another record, the delete will fail. If The Family Type is Relationship, then the possible values are: 
ACTION_INSERTONLY ACTION_INSERTUPDATEACTION_UPDATEONLY ACTION_DELETE 
Predecessor Action PRED_ACTION Character
The value in this column will determine the action that will be applied to the Predecessor Family records. The possible values are: 
ACTION_INSERTONLY ACTION_INSERTUPDATE ACTION_UPDATEONLY ACTION_DELETE ACTION_PURGE ACTION_LOCATE 
If The Family Type is Entity then the values needs to be:
ACTION_NONE 
Successor Action SUCC_ACTION Character
The value in this column will determine the action that will be applied to the Successor Family records. The possible values are: 
ACTION_INSERTONLY ACTION_INSERTUPDATE ACTION_UPDATEONLYACTION_DELETE ACTION_PURGE ACTION_LOCATE 
If The Family Type is Entity then the values needs to be:
ACTION_NONE 
Insert with Null Values? OPTION_INSERT_ON_NULL BooleanWhen setting field values on a new record, if a value coming across is NULL, the field values will be set to NULL if this option is set to True.Update with Null Values? OPTION_UPDATE_ON_NULL BooleanWhen setting field values on an existing record, if a value coming across is NULL, the field values will be set to NULL if this option is set to True.Replace an Existing Link? OPTION_REPLACE_EXISTING_LINK Boolean
The Replace Existing Relationship option is used to determine how a relationship is to be maintained by its cardinality definition. 
For example, the relationship Location Contains Asset that is defined in the Configuration Manager. It has a cardinality defined as Zero or One to Zero or One, has a Location LP-2300, and contains the Asset P-2300. If, in the data load, you assign the Asset P-5000 to be contained in the Location LP-2300, and you have set the Replace Existing Link property to True, then the data loader will link P-5000 to LP-2300 and unlink P-2300 from LP-2300. This assumes that P-5000 is not currently linked to another location. The same is true for a relationship that is defined as Zero or One to Zero or Many, or Zero or Many to Zero or One. 
Allow Change of Family? OPTION_ALLOW_CHANGE_OF_FAMILY Boolean
Allows the data loader to move an entity from one family to another. 
For example, this would allow an entity that is currently assigned to the Centrifugal Pump family to be moved to the Reciprocating Pump family. 
All relationships will be maintained as long as the family to which the entity is being moved allows the same relationships. 
Note:  Because of the extra processing required, by selecting this option, the interface performance will decrease.
