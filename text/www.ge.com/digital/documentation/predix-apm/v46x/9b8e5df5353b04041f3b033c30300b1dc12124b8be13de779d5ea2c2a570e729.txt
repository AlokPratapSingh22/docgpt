ExceptionsAbout Exceptions Exceptions are action items that must be completed by the team before delivering a change. In the Application Settings for MOC, you can create Exception records to identify the type of Exception that must be created for an Answer Option. When you respond to Questions in a Checklist in the Change Project, Exceptions are automatically created by copying the Exceptions that you created. Default Exceptions in MoC
