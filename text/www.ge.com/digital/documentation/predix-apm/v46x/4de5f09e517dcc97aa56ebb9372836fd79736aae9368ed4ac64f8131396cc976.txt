Second Quarter of 2020Release Date: May 8, 2020This topic provides a list of product changes released for this module on this date.
Table 1. Enhancements and New Features
The following enhancements and new features have been added.
DescriptionTracking IDTo enhance usability of the Thickness Monitoring (TM) Assets and Thickness Monitoring (TM) Functional Location Data Loaders, the following values are now updated on the Interface Log record generated by the data loader execution.
FieldDescriptionNumber of Records ProcessedIncremented by one for each Thickness Measurement Location (TML) processed from the Excel.Number of Records RejectedIncremented by one for each Thickness Measurement Location (TML) record that encountered an error when being created or updated, which resulted in the record not being committed.Number of Records CreatedIncremented by one for each new Thickness Measurement Location (TML) record that is successfully created.Number of Records UpdatedIncremented by one for each existing Thickness Measurement Location (TML) record that is successfully updated.
US390890Previously, you could search records from all the Thickness Measurement families in the Global Search. Now, all families from Thickness Measurement have been excluded from Global Search, except for the following families:AnalysisAsset Corrosion AnalysisCorrosionDatapointMaterials of ConstructionPipe PropertiesPiping Nominal T-MinPiping StressPV Nominal T-MinPV StressTank Nominal T-MinTank StressTank T-Min Annular RingThickness Monitoring TaskThickness Measurement LocationTML GroupHowever, you can configure a family to be included or excluded from the Global Search using the Search Configuration.US384419The performance of the Analysis Overview workspace and the TMLs section has been significantly improved. To facilitate this enhancement, the Based on field now appears as a hyperlink that allows you to access the Thickness Measurement Locations (TMLs) associated with the analyses in the Based on window.US373718
Table 2. Resolved Issues
The following issues, which existed in one or more previous versions, have been resolved.
DescriptionTracking IDPreviously, the Thickness Monitoring Overview page was filtered based on the asset hierarchy context, even though the unit key was passed in the Uniform Resource Locator (URL). This issue has been resolved. Now, the Thickness Monitoring Overview page is filtered based on the provided unit key.US384797To enhance usability, the performance of Thickness Monitoring data loader has been improved when creating TML records that are directly linked to the equipment or functional location.DE131763Previously, in the Thickness Monitoring Analysis Overview page, the More Options button () did not appear after certain workflows, such as deleting a nested TML Group. This issue has been resolved.DE131708Previously, in the TM Dataloggers page, in the Send To and Receive From sections, the Thickness Measurement Locations (TMLs) were not sorted. This issue has been resolved. Now, the TMLs are sorted in alphanumerical order of the corresponding TML IDs.DE128017Previously, in the TMLs section of the Analysis Overview page, the values in the following columns displayed the system code ID instead of the description:AccessTank TypeVessel Type This issue has been resolved.DE125402Previously, in a Thickness Measurement Location (TML), if the first two measurements were of equal value, and the value was less than the value in the Minimum Thickness field, and the Use Minimum Corrosion Rate was not selected in the Corrosion Analysis Settings, the Scheduled Next Inspection Date value was calculated incorrectly. This issue has been resolved. Now, the Scheduled Next Inspection Date is calculated as per the value in the Last Measurement Date field.DE123762Previously, when you performed the Minimum Thickness (T-Min) calculation for more than 400 thickness measurement locations from the T-Min Calculator workspace, an error occurred. This issue has been resolved. Now, a pagination has been introduced to the T-Min Calculator workspace to load 100 thickness measurement locations per page.DE123305Previously, the values in the Nominal Wall Thickness and Internal Diameter fields were incorrect in two records in the Pipe Properties family. This issue has been resolved. Now, the values in the records are updated as below:
ScheduleNominal Diameter - NPSNominal Diameter - DNOutside DiameterNominal Wall Thickness (Old)Nominal Wall Thickness (New)Internal Diameter (Old)Internal Diameter (New)302.5652.875 (Inches)0.125 (Inches)0.188 (Inches)2.625 (Inches)2.499 (Inches)403690036 (Inches)0.688 (Inches)0.75 (Inches)34.624 (Inches)34.5 (Inches)
DE123035Previously, on the Corrosion Analysis Settings page, when a user entered numeric values using comma as the decimal separator (for example: 1,9) the numeric value was not saved correctly. This issue has been resolved.DE122373Previously, if the measurements of a Thickness Measurement Location are at high loss, and you attempted to organize the Thickness Measurement Locations from the Organize TMLs workspace, an error occurred indicating that the calculation failed. This issue has been resolved.DE120290
Previously, when you selected a Thickness Measurement Location (TML) group from the Analysis Overview page, and then selected the Organize TMLs option, the TMLs present in the selected TML Group were displayed along with the TMLs from the other TML Groups in the Organize TMLs section. This issue has been resolved. Now, the TMLs from the selected TML Group does not display in the Organize TMLs section.
