General ReferenceGeneral ReferenceThis section contains information on NR13, State Management, and Site Filtering.About NR13NR13 is a Brazilian Regulatory Standard issued by the Department of Labor, applicable only to sites in Brazil. Its general purpose is to ensure safety in all aspects of designing, installing, operating, and maintaining certain types of equipment.The NR13 module expands GE Digital APM's baseline function to support the collecting and storing of technical data that is required to create NR13-compliant inspection reports. The module also adds two new inspection reports specifically for NR13 inspections.The NR13 module is enabled by the NR13 license.You can download the NR13ModuleEnglish.pdf (PDF).Inspection Management State ManagementThe diagram below shows the workflow of the baseline State Management process as it applies to Inspection Recommendations. Details
The Proposed state is the initial state of all Inspection Recommendations.By default, states will appear in the Recommended Actions pane when you are viewing an Inspection Recommendation or the Record Manager. Operations that are not in reserved states can be accessed by selecting an Inspection Recommendation and then selecting .
Reserved States and OperationsThe following tables indicate whether or not the baseline states and operations are reserved. You cannot remove or modify reserved states or operations. You can, however, add your own states and operations to the State Assignment.State CaptionReserved StateSecurity RoleApproved NoSC Recommendation Implementer RoleCancelledNoNoneCompletedNoNoneIn Progress NoSC Recommendation Implementer RolePending Approval NoSC Recommendation Reviewer RolePending ReviewNoMI Inspection SupervisorProposed YesMI InspectorRejected NoNoneSuperseded YesNoneOperationsReserved OperationPredecessor StatesSuccessor StateApproveNoPending ApprovalApprovedCancelNo

The Work Pack family employs the GE Digital APM
Site Control; however, Work Packs are not linked to specific assets or Functional Locations. When a Work Pack record is initially created, it is assigned the default site of the user who created the record. The site of the root level Work Pack can only be modified prior to saving the record.

Tip: For more information, refer to the Site Filtering section of the documentation.

If a multi-site user who has access to every site in a root-level Work Pack record links child records from multiple sites to that Work Pack record, another user who does not have access to every sites may only see a potion of the data associated with that record. 
Tip:  Although having site-specific tasks is allowed by GE Digital APM, Inspection Management Best Practices recommends that Work Packs and their associated tasks be limited to a single location. 
Example: Work Pack Records 
Consider an organization that has three sites, Site X, Site Y, and Site Z. Work Pack A, a global record, contains the following tasks:
Task 1: Assigned to Site XTask 2: Assigned to Site YTask 3: Assigned to Site Z
Scenario 1: User assigned to only Site X.
When this user views Work Pack A, he or she will see the following:
Work Pack A.Task 1.
Scenario 2: User assigned to both Site Y and Site X.
When this user views Work Pack A, he or she will see the following:
Work Pack A.Task 1.Task 2.

Scenario 3: Super User

When this user views Work Pack A, he or she will see the following:
Work Pack A.Task 1.Task 2.Task 3.
Important: Although all tasks are contained within the global record Work Pack A, the user will only see the tasks associated with the current site to which they are assigned.

Inspection Management Data ModelInspection Management simply offers a customized view of individual records that belong to families in the data model. In addition, each step in the Inspection Management workflow allows you to create, view, or manage those records.The following diagram illustrates how records are linked to one another within Inspection Management. The shaded boxes represent entity families, and the arrows represent relationship families. You can determine the direction of each relationship from the direction of the arrowhead: the box to the left of each arrow head is the predecessor in that relationship, and the box to the right of each arrowhead is the successor in that relationship. For example, you can see that Inspection records are linked to Inspection Recommendation records through the Has Recommendations relationship, where the Inspection family is the predecessor. While the image shows one box for the Inspection family, GE Digital APM provides the following Inspection families as part of the baseline Inspection Management content: Bundle Inspection  Bundle Sub-Inspection  API 510 External Checklist  API 510 Internal Exchanger Checklist  API 510 Internal Checklist  API 570 External Checklist  API 653 External Checklist  API 653 Internal Checklist  External PRD Checklist  Full Inspection  General Inspection  PRD Pop Test Checklist  Pressure Test Inspection  Pressure Test Sub Inspection Pipe Rotation EventInspection Health EvaluationIn the image above, the Inspection box is the predecessor to the Checklist Finding box. In the baseline database, however, only the following Inspection families are related to the Checklist Finding family: API 510 External Checklist  API 510 Internal Exchanger Checklist  API 510 Internal Checklist  API 570 External Checklist  API 653 External Checklist  API 653 Internal Checklist  External PRD Checklist  PRD Pop Test Checklist Note that although both the Equipment and Functional Location families are related to the Inspection Profile family, this documentation assumes that you will create Inspection Profiles only for equipment. You will typically not create Inspection Profiles for locations.
