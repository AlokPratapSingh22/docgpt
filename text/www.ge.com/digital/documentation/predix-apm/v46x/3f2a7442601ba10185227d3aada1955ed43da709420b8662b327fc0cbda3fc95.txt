Compliance ConfigurationAbout Compliance Strategy TemplatesCompliance Strategy Templates help you manage your assets and generate recommendations based on a selected policy.Creating a Compliance Strategy Template lays the groundwork for creating a cohesive and compliant Inspection Plan for linked assets. When an MI Compliance Administrator creates a Compliance Strategy template, they must choose a policy to link to the template that will enable recommendation generation when the Inspection Plan creation is initiated. After the policy is selected, the MI Compliance Administrator then links assets to the Compliance Strategy Template. At this point, Inspection Plans can be created by the MI Compliance Analyst or the MI Compliance Approver. When the Inspection Plan creation is initiated, the policy selected in the Compliance Strategy Template is executed against the assets that are linked to the template. Then, Inspection Plans are created, and recommendations are generated according to the guidelines specified in the policy. When an asset is linked to multiple Compliance Strategy Templates, the policy for each template executes, and the recommendations are linked to the Inspection Plan of that asset.
