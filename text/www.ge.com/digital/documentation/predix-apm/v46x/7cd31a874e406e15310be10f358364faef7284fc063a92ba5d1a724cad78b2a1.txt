Table 1. Enhancements and New Features
The following enhancements and new features have been added.
DescriptionTracking IDTo enhance productivity, you can now export data directly to a CSV file from GE Digital APM without using a data table chart.

Table 2. Resolved Issues
The following issues, which existed in one or more previous versions, have been resolved.
DescriptionTracking IDPreviously, if you opened a saved template for an asset in the Context Browser and then attempted to switch to another asset, the template information was not retained, and the New Time Series Analysis view was displayed. This issued has been resolved. Now, you can toggle assets that belong to the same classification type and retain the template along with the plotted charts. Additionally, for All Resources templates, you can toggle assets irrespective of the classification type.US559304Previously, for a time series chart, when you attempted to configure a large number of tags for a specific asset, you were unable to configure more than 40 tags at a time. This issue has been resolved. Now, the tag limit is increased to 70 tags. US558913Previously, in SmartSignal charts, when you dragged and dropped nodes in the Tag Browser section, the chart did not reload. This issue has been resolved. DE180770Previously, in an Analysis template associated with an Alert, the condition based filter did not load. This was because the condition or value based filter query failed to retrieve the data and you had to refresh the browser to re-query the data. This resulted in re-query of all data in the analysis template. This issue has been resolved. Now, the retry option is added to re-query only the failed condition based filter or value based filter.
