Table 4. Resolved Issues
The following issues that existed in one or more previous releases have been resolved.
DescriptionTracking IDPreviously, in the Select Context window, when you attempted to search for an asset, sometimes, the asset did not appear in the search results. This issue occurred because the search results displayed only the first 10 records in a sequence that matched the search string you specified, and the asset that you attempted to search did not match any of these records. Search results appear as expected.DE102986Select and Cancel were not visible upon resize. The Context Browser resizes to show the options to 'Select' or 'Cancel' when a user resizes the browser window.DE96140The GET call from /sites was returning all the attributes, including the deleted ones, because of the cache. This has been moved to the GEDA backlog.DE94480When you passed anything other than the allowed parent entity CCOM Class, the task status failed. This has been moved to the GEDA backlog.DE83773You were unable to ingest a tag with tagType as computed or sensor. Ingestion for a tagType as computed or sensor works as expected.DE76027If a network was part of a sub-network, then it was not searchable. This feature is being deprecated in April 2019.DE75564The Reserved Attributes Advanced search was not working when system had large volumes of reserved attributes. The Reserved Attributes Advanced search works as expected when the system has large volumes of reserved attributes.DE75378You were intermittently unable to see ingestion logs in IE. Ingestion logs in IE are displayed as expected.DE73709An internal server error displayed if the user sent a request with a Malformed URL. The correct error message now displays if the user sends a request with a Malformed URL.DE68896A newly created alert (count) was not seen immediately without refreshing the page; the Date picker was not reflecting the current time. A newly created alert (count) is now reflected in the alert count.DE61811The Timestamp was incorrect if the time zone in user preferences is set to UTC + 14(Kiritimati). The Timestamp now displays correctly in the asset faceplate.DE57601
