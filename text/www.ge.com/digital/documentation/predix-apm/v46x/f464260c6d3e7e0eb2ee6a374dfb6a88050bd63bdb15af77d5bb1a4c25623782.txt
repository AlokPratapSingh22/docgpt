Reliability Recommendation RecordsReliability Recommendation Records
Recommendation records in Reliability Analytics store details of a recommendation and the progress associated with getting the recommendation approved and implemented. The following table provides an alphabetical list and description of the fields that exist for the Reliability Recommendation family. The information in the table reflects the baseline state and behavior of these fields. This list is not comprehensive.
This family is enabled for site filtering, which means that records in this family can be assigned to a specific site, and will only be accessible to users who are assigned to the same site and have the appropriate license and family privileges. For more information, refer to the Sites section of the documentation.
