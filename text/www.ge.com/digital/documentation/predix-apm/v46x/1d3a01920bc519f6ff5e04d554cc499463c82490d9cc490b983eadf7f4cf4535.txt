This value is generated automatically by the GE Digital APM system and does not appear in the System Action datasheet. In System Reliability Analyses, GUIDs are used to identify records because Entity Keys will not exist until a record is saved. Because a System Reliability Analysis may contain unsaved records, it is necessary to use a value that uniquely identifies those records within the system. 
NameCharacter The name of the action. 
You can define this field manually. This value is used to identify Actions in the System Reliability Analyses. For instance, the Name column appears by default in the Actions section in the workspace and displays values that exist in the Name field to identify the System Action records that are displayed in the workspace.

 Description TextA text field that stores any additional information about the Action. 
You can enter text manually in the Description box.
This field is available in the General section of the Properties pane. 
 Detection probability (%) Number A numeric value representing the probability that the Action will identify a potential failure resulting from any Risk and correct that failure before it occurs. 
By default, this value is set to 100 by default. For an Action with no assigned Risks, any value stored in this field will be ignored.
For example, a System Condition Monitor record with the Detection Probability value 50 has a 50% chance of identifying a potential failure resulting from a Risk. In other words, the Action will detect one out of two potential failures resulting from any Risks assigned to the Action.
This field is available in the Condition Monitor section of the Properties pane. 
 GUID Character A value that uniquely identifies the record within a System Reliability Analysis. 
This value is generated automatically by the GE Digital APM system and does not appear on the System Condition Monitor datasheet. In System Reliability Analyses, GUIDs are used to identify records because Entity Keys will not exist until a record is saved. Since a System Reliability Analysis may contain unsaved records, it is necessary to use a value that uniquely identifies those records within the system.

The following table provides an alphabetical list and description of the fields that exist for the System Inspection family and appear by default on the System Inspection datasheet. The information in the table reflects the baseline state and behavior of these fields. This list is not comprehensive. 
This family is enabled for site filtering, which means that records in this family can be assigned to a specific site, and will only be accessible to users who are assigned to the same site and have the appropriate license and family privileges. For more information, refer to the Sites section of the documentation.
Field CaptionData TypeDescriptionBehavior and UsageAction Cost Number A numeric value that specifies the cost associated with any materials or personnel needed to complete the Action.

Description TextA text field that stores any additional information about the Action. 
You can enter text manually in the Description box. 
This field is available in the General section of the Properties pane. 
Detection Probability Number A numeric value representing the probability that the Action will identify a potential failure resulting from any Risk and correct that failure before it occurs. 
By default, this value is set to 100. For an Action with no assigned Risks, any value stored in this field will be ignored.
An Action can detect a potential failure only when the Action occurs during a Risk's PF Interval, as defined by the value in the PF Interval and PF Interval Units fields in the System Risk record. If the Action does not occur during the PF Interval, the Action cannot identify the potential failure, and the value in the Detection Probability field will be ignored. To make the Action occur during the PF Interval of a Risk, you can manually modify the values in the PF Interval and PF Interval Units fields of the System Risk record, or you can optimize the Action.
For example, setting the Detection Probability to 50 would indicate that the Action has a 50% chance of identifying a potential failure resulting from any Risk if the Action occurs during the PF Interval of the Risks. In other words, the Action will detect one out of two potential failures resulting from any Risks assigned to the Action when the Action occurs during the PF Interval of the Risks.
This field is available in the Inspection section of the Properties pane. 
Duration Number 
A numeric value that, combined with the value in the Duration Units field, identifies the total time needed to complete the Action. 
For example, if the value in the Duration field is 4 and the value in the Duration Units field is Hours, then the Action will take four hours to complete. 

By default, this value is set to 0 (zero). 
This field is available in the Inspection section of the Properties pane.

In System Reliability Analyses, GUIDs are used to identify records because Entity Keys will not exist until a record is saved. Since a System Reliability Analysis may contain unsaved records, it is necessary to use a value that uniquely identifies those records within the system.
Interval Number 
A numeric value that, combined with the value in the Interval Units field, indicates how often the Action will occur. 
For example, if the value in the Interval field is 4 and the value in the Interval Units field is Months, then the Action will occur every four months during the simulation period.

This field is available in the General section of the Properties pane. 
One Time Action Logical Indicates whether the Action will occur one time or will be repeated more than once. 
If this check box is selected, the Action will occur once. If this check box is cleared, the Action will occur more than once. For example, an Action to inspect the vibration level of a pump might occur several times a year. In this case, the One Time Action check box of the corresponding System Inspection record would be cleared. An Action to inspect a newly installed pump for any installation errors might occur only once, in which case the One Time Action check box of the corresponding System Inspection record would be selected. By default, this check box is cleared.

This field does not appear by default on the System Analysis datasheet. 
Analysis Start Date DateThe first date of the analysis. 
You can define this field manually. This field is labeled Start Date in the Definition section of the Analysis Summary workspace. The amount of time defined by the values in the Period and Period Units fields is added to the value in this field to determine how long the simulation will run. 
This field is labeled Start Date on the datasheet.
Confidence NumberA numeric value that represents the confidence level of simulation results. 
This value determines the Optimistic and Pessimistic values in the Histogram plot in the Simulation Results workspace. The default value for this field is 90. If you accept the default value, when you look at the Histogram plot, you will know that there is a 90% chance that the value in any cell in the grids in the Simulation Results workspace in the analysis lies within the range between the Optimistic and Pessimistic values. 
This field is labeled Confidence Level on the datasheet.
Cost Plot BinaryA field that is used internally by the GE Digital APM system to store the image of the Total Cost plot. 
You should not modify the value in this field. Doing so will cause the analysis to become corrupt, and you will no longer be able to open it.

Description TextA text field that stores any additional information about the analysis. 
You can define this value by entering text manually. 
This field is labeled Analysis Description on the datasheet. 
Histogram Bins Number A numeric value that defines the number of bins, or columns, that will be displayed on the Histogram plot. The default value for this field is 20. If you accept the default value, when you look at the Histogram plot on the Simulation Results workspace, there will be 20 bins on the Histogram plot. Number of Iterations Number A numeric value that identifies the number of times the system will be simulated in order to compile simulation results. 
In the simple Monte Carlo example provided in this documentation, one iteration represents a single roll of the dice. The more iterations you use in an analysis, the more reliable the simulation results will be. The default value for this field is 1,000.
The value you specify in the Iterations field must be compatible with the value that you specify in the Confidence field. The required number of iterations is dependent on the confidence boundary, as defined by the value in the Confidence field. The following equation is used to determine the required number of iterations:

Minimum Number of Iterations = 40/(1- Confidence Field Value)

In other words, the number of iterations must be high enough to provide a statistically significant confidence level. For example, a System Reliability Analysis with a value of 90 in the Confidence field would require a value of at least 400 in the Iterations field, as shown in the following calculation:
Minimum Number of Iterations = 40/(1-90%)
Minimum Number of Iterations = 40/.1
Minimum Number of Iterations = 400
If you enter a value in the Iterations field that is below the desired value, an error message will appear, and you will be required to specify another value before you can save the analysis.
Period Number A numeric value that identifies the time period over which an analysis occurs. By default, this value is set to 1. The value in the Period Units field determines the time units that will be applied to the value in the Period field. Period Units CharacterThe time units associated with the value in the Period field. 
You can select a value from one of the following options:
Hours Days Weeks Months Years 
Random Seed Logical Indicates whether or not different random numbers will be used for the system-generated inputs for each run of the simulation so that different results are returned each time. 
By default, this value is set to False. If the Random Seed field is set to True, different inputs will be used for each simulation so that different results will be generated each time the simulation is run even if you have made no changes to the analysis. If the Random Seed field is set to False, the same results will be generated each time you run the simulation, provided that you have made no changes to the analysis. 
This field is labeled Enable Random Seed on the datasheet. 
Resource Cost Plot BinaryA field that is used internally by the GE Digital APM system to store the image of the Resource Cost plot. 
You should not modify the value in this field. Doing so will cause the analysis to become corrupt, and you will no longer be able to open it. 
This field does not appear by default on the System Analysis datasheet. 
Resource Occurrence Plot BinaryA field that is used internally by the GE Digital APM system to store the image of the Resource Occurrence plot.

This field does not appear by default on the System Analysis datasheet. 
Time Analysis Type CharacterA field whose value determines how results are displayed in the Total Cost Trend Plot and Trend Plot. By default, this value is Yearly. If this field is set to Yearly, the x-axis will display results for every year in the simulation period. If this field is set to Monthly, the x-axis will display results for every month in the simulation period. Visual Attributes TextA field that is used internally by GE Digital APM and stores visual information, such as chart settings and diagram positioning. 
You should not modify the value in this field. Doing so will cause the analysis to become corrupt, and you will no longer be able to open it.

You can enter a description of the Risk into this field manually. 
This field appears in the General section.
Failures Without Replacement LogicalIndicates whether or not the piece of equipment or location is replaced after each failure that results from the Risk. By default, this check box is cleared. If this check box is selected, the piece of equipment or location is not replaced after each failure (as good as old). If this check box is cleared, the piece of equipment or location is replaced after each failure (as good as new). Fixed Unplanned Correction Cost NumberIndicates the set cost of a piece of equipment or location when it fails as a result of the Risk. Fixed cost does not change as a result of other variables, such as downtime. An example of fixed unplanned correction cost is the cost of a new piece of equipment. 
By default, this field contains the value 0.
This field appears in the Correction section.
Is Active Logical Indicates whether or not the piece of equipment's or location's operating time accumulates while the system is running. After a potential failure is detected, this value indicates whether the piece of equipment's or location's remaining life is reduced when the system is active or latent. 
This value is a characteristic of the piece of equipment or location to which the Risk is related and should be the same for all Risks related to the same piece of equipment or location. By default, this check box is selected. If the check box is selected, the piece of equipment's or location's operating time will accumulate while the system is running, and the Is Latent check box should be cleared. This means that the v or location will lose lifetime while the system is running.
For example, when a car (i.e., the system) is moving, a tire's (i.e., piece of equipment's) lifetime is being used up. The tire is active. 
This field is available in the Simulations Options section.
Is Latent LogicalIndicates whether or not the piece of equipment's or location's operating time accumulates while the system is idle. After a potential failure is detected, this value indicates whether the piece of equipment's or location's remaining life is reduced when the system is active or latent. 
This value is a characteristic of the piece of equipment or location to which the Risk is related and should be the same for all Risks related to the same piece of equipment or location. By default, this check box is cleared. If check box is selected, the piece of equipment's or location's operating time will accumulate while the system is idle, and the Is Active check box should be cleared. This means the piece of equipment or location will lose lifetime when the system is not running.
For example, when a car (i.e., the system) is idle and not being used, failures can occur that will affect the hydraulic braking system (i.e., piece of equipment's). The rate of these failures is not impacted by the car being used or being idle, and is therefore latent in nature.
Last Failure DateIndicates the most recent date that the piece of equipment or location failed due to the Risk. You can use the Calendar tool to select the date of the most recent equipment or location replacement. Name CharacterThe name of the Risk. You can enter the name of the Risk in this field manually. This value is used to identify Risks in the System Reliability Analysis. Number of Subcomponents NumberThe number of subcomponents to which the Risk applies. By default, this field contains the value 1. The value should be greater than 1 only if the Failure Without Replacement check box is selected. Percentage of PF Interval to Wait NumberA numeric value that indicates how long to wait to repair the piece of equipment or location after detecting a potential failure due to this Risk. 
By default, this field contains the value 0 and should be used only if the Repair Immediately check box is cleared. This value indicates at what percentage of the value in the PF Interval field the piece of equipment or location should be repaired.
For example, an engineer monitors a Risk more frequently after a potential failure is detected and does not want to repair the piece of equipment or location immediately. If a potential failure is detected at the start of the PF Interval, and the engineer knows that the piece of equipment or location will not actually fail for 10 more days (i.e., a PF Interval of 10), he might decide to initiate a repair strategy six days later, or at 60 percent of the PF Interval. In this case, the Percentage of PF Interval to Wait is 60 percent.
PF Interval NumberThe time between when a potential failure is detectable and when an actual failure will occur. By default, this field contains the value 0. This value is used along with the value in the Percentage of PF Interval to Wait field to determine when a piece of equipment or location should be repaired after a failure. The P-F Interval is determined by the user and is not calculated by the system. PF Interval Units CharacterThe time units associated with the PF Interval. 
by default, this value is set to Days. You can select from a list of the following options:
Minutes Hours Days Weeks Months Years 

Planned Correction Cost 
 
NumberThe total cost (i.e., fixed cost plus variable cost) of a planned correction that will prevent the Risk from resulting in a functional failure. An example of a planned correction is a routine equipment cleaning. By default, this field contains the value 0. A planned correction does not happen as a result of a failure. Planned Correction Duration NumberThe time needed to implement a planned correction. By default, this field contains the value 0. Planned Correction Duration Units CharacterThe time units associated with the Planned Correction Duration. 
By default, this value is set to Days. You can select from a list of the following options:
Hours Days Weeks Months Years 
Repair Immediately LogicalA value that indicates whether or not the piece of equipment or location should be repaired immediately if a potential failure due to this Risk is detected. By default, this check box is selected. If the check box is selected, the piece of equipment or location should be repaired as soon as an inspection detects a failure, regardless of the remaining life of the piece of equipment or location. If the check box is cleared, the piece of equipment or location should be repaired according to the value in the Percentage of PF Interval to Wait field. Variable Unplanned Correction Cost NumberA number that indicates the variable cost associated with the downtime of an piece of equipment or location when it fails due to the Risk. An example of variable unplanned correction cost is the cost of labor per time period of the mechanic that repairs the piece of equipment or location. By default, this field contains the value 0.Variable Unplanned Correction Cost Units CharacterThe time units associated with the Variable Unplanned Correction Cost. 
By default, this value is set to Per Day. You can select from a list of the following options:
Per Hour Per Day Per Week Per Month Per Year

Production Contribution Number
The percentage that this piece of equipment or location will contribute to the overall production capacity of its parent system, with respect to other elements that are running in parallel to the piece of equipment or location.
For example, if two pieces of equipment are running in parallel with one another and each one contributes 50% to the overall production output, you would enter a value of 50 in the Production Contribution field of each piece of equipment. The Production Contribution of each element in the Diagram will be used to calculate the overall production loss of the parent system when one or more elements are down.

By default, the Production Contribution is set to 100. If the piece of equipment does not contribute to the overall production output of its parent system, you can set the Production Contribution to 0 (zero).
