Table 2. Resolved Issues
The following issues, which existed in one or more previous versions, have been resolved.
DescriptionTracking IDPreviously, when plotting a tag in an analysis chart, if the source unit of measure and the standard unit of measure were the same, you were unable to add a conversion in the Units of Measure conversion table. This issue has been resolved. Now, you can select the source unit of measure from a drop-down list in the Plotted Tags section for conversion. Additionally, the standard abbreviations are now used in the Units of Measure tableDE192910Previously, in a Time Series Analysis chart, when you modified the SYSTEM OF MEASURE, the chart was not updated with the corresponding data. Also, when you modified the Unit of Measure from the PLOTTED TAGS section, the chart was not updated. This issue has been resolved. Now, the time series chart displays data corresponding to the modified System of Measure and or Unit of Measure.DE187183Previously, in an Analysis when a template had a condition based filter saved in the Filters tab, if you switched to another asset that did not have the same tags as the previous asset, then the CONDITION BASED FILTER did not load any tags irrespective of whether the tag exists or not for the selected asset. This issue has been resolved. Now, the condition based filter displays all the tags for the asset, and the slider for the non configured tags remains zero (0). For the configured tags the right value range is displayed on the slider.DE174686Previously, in an Analysis for a selected asset with a defined template, when you selected Show Tag Information in the chart settings, the chart table displayed the non configured (NC) tags and no data (ND) tags along with the configured tags that have data. Also, the chart table displayed other assets as well that are not part of the current chart analysis. This issue has been resolved. Now, only the configured tags that have data corresponding to the selected asset are displayed.DE187611Previously, in Time Series Analysis template, when you selected Calculate Delta
 on a chart for a One-Up layout, and when you attempted delta calculation for the tags in the chart, the PINNED DATA pane was displayed for only one tag value. This issue has been resolved. Now, when you select two points and plot the pin markers PIN 1 and PIN 2 in the chart for delta calculation, the PINNED DATA displays the values of all the tags.DE187216Previously, in time series analysis template with X-Y (Line) and X-Y (Scatter) chart, the Lasso selection   did not have the XY, X, and Y-axis functionalities. This issue has been resolved. Now, the XY, X, and Y-axis functionalities are added in the Lasso selection.DE189853Previously, in a Time Series Analysis chart, the selected unit of measure did not appear in a single line. This issue has been resolved. Now, the unit of measure for the tags appear in a single line.DE188422
