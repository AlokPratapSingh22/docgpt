Table 3. Resolved Issues
The following issues, which existed in one or more previous versions, have been resolved.
DescriptionTracking IDPreviously, Reference Document features that were not available in Predix APM were accessible in the user interface. This issue has been resolved.

This issue has been resolved.DE162849Previously, when you manually entered a date in the measurement date field in the two-digit format, (for example, 19 instead of 2019), and then saved the record, the date was updated to the current date and saved. This issue has been resolved.DE159595Previously, when creating a new Conditional Alert record, if you selected an email recipient from the Fixed Distribution List drop-down menu and saved the record, Conditional Alert email was not sent to the recipient. This issue has been resolved.DE158319Previously, when a conditional alert email was generated, the timestamp did not appear in the email. This issue has been resolved.DE158318Previously, when a conditional alert was executed, the alert message was blank in the following scenarios: The conditional alert was associated with a query.The query contained a subquery. This issue has been resolved.DE158316Previously, if you used the recent browser versions to access the GE Digital APM system, and then exported a datasheet or result grid to PDF, the PDF print was broken and resulted in a blank output. This issue has been resolved.DE158106Previously, when you attempted to configure the Reference Document Server credentials, and if you assigned a large number of Sites, Groups, or Roles, or if the Shared Directory path was longer than 100 characters, an error occurred, and you could not save the record. This issue has been resolved.DE157810Previously, the documentation of the URLs to create and open records in Record Manager was incorrect. This issue has been resolved.DE156928Previously, in the Reference Documents list that was displayed in an analysis (for example, in a Root Cause Analysis), the Last Updated Date did not use the correct display format for the user's culture. This issue has been resolved.DE156923Previously, in a datasheet, when the Turn On Help Text feature was enabled, the multi value fields did not display the help text correctly. This issue has been resolved.DE153621Previously, when you displayed records in a Bulk Data Form and selected a Datasheet that used Column layout, the default column captions were displayed instead of the captions defined in the datasheet layout. This issue has been resolved.DE150303Previously, if you deleted or inactivated a predefined value used in the drop-down list for a field, and you viewed an existing record using that value, a null value was displayed. This issue has been resolved. Now inactive is appended to the displayed value and you can no longer select the inactive value when editing the field.DE137420
