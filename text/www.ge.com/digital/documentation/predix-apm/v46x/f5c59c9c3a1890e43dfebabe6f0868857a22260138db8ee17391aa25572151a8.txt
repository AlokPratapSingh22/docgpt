Suggested Compliance Strategy TemplatesAbout Suggested TemplatesUsers can generate suggested Compliance Strategy Templates for assets in the Assets without Templates section of the Compliance Management Overview page. This section contains assets that do not have linked Compliance Strategy Templates, but match query results that are associated with existing templates. The Suggested Templates are based on query results used in Compliance Strategy Templates for adding assets.When a user creates a Compliance Strategy Template, they can add assets using a query. When they select the query that adds the assets, the query is added to the Compliance Strategy Template record and is saved for later use. In the Assets without Templates section of the Compliance Management Overview page, a user can select the Suggest Templates button to generate suggested Compliance Strategy Templates for each asset. When this job is executed, the queries that are defined in Compliance Strategy Template records are executed for all assets in the Assets without Templates section. If the assets find a match with a query related to a Compliance Strategy Template, the Compliance Strategy Template becomes the suggested template for the asset. If a Compliance Strategy Template does not have a query attached to the record, it is excluded from the Suggest Templates job. Additionally, if an asset does not match a query that is attached to a Compliance Strategy Template, it will not receive a suggested Compliance Strategy Template.Suggest a Compliance Strategy Template for an AssetUsers can get suggested Compliance Strategy Templates for assets that are in the Assets without Templates section of the Compliance Management Overview page.Before You BeginAn MI Compliance Administrator must have selected a query on your Compliance Strategy Templates by adding assets to the template using a query.If a Compliance Strategy Template does not have a query attached to the record, it is excluded from the Suggest Templates job.
