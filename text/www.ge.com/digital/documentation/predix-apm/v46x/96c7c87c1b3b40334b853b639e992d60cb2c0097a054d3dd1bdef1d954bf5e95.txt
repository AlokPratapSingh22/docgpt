Tracking ItemsAbout Tracking ItemsA Tracking Item allows you to monitor the performance of an Asset and set up notifications to be sent when specific reevaluation criteria have been met (i.e. cost and the number of failures).A Tracking Item queries the failure and cost data from work history records linked to the selected equipment or functional location. Queries are automatically initiated when the track item Start Date is reached. By default, the values in the Work History Total Cost field for Maintenance Work are used to derive the cost value used for the Count. The work history costs that occur prior to the track item Start Date will not be included in the Count. A track item alert is triggered when either the total cost or total number of failure events threshold count is met. After an alert is sent, the Count reverts to zero, and the process is repeated until the track items instruction is terminated.Access a Tracking ItemProcedure

A list of Tracking Items associated with the selected RCA appears in the workspace. 
In the upper-left corner of the workspace, select .
The Add/Edit Tracking Item window appears, displaying a blank datasheet.
As needed, enter values in the available fields. 
Note: Above the Tracking Item Details datasheet, the Related Assets box appears, which contains the ID of the Asset to which the RCA Tracking Item is linked. If the RCA Tracking Item is not linked to an Asset, this box will be blank. You can select Search next to the Related Assets box to search for an Asset and link the Asset to the Tracking Item.
Select .
The Tracking Item is saved.
Results
When you create a Tracking item, a link is automatically created between the Tracking Item and the RCA.
