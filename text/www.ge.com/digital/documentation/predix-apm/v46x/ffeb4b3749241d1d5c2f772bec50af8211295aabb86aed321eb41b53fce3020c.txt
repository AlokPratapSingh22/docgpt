EU_PIPE_EQPT
This Policy is used in the Compliance Strategies to generate European Compliance Recommendations for Piping with respect to the Asset family. The following image illustrates the model of the EU_PIPE_EQPT policy:
This policy uses two input nodes:Asset: This is an entity node which represents the Equipment family.Piping: This is a constant node of string Piping.
The node, Asset Technical Data Filter is a Query node that runs the EU_Piping_Filter_EQ query. The Asset Technical Data Filter node uses the Entity Key of the Asset represented by the Asset node and the string represented by the Piping node as prompts for the EU_Piping_Filter_EQ query. When the Policy is executed, it generates a result set that contains the following information:The Entity Key of the Asset Technical Data related to the Asset represented by the Asset node.The Family ID of Asset Technical Data related to the Asset represented by the Asset node.The Strategy ID used to generate the Compliance Recommendation.The policy then uses this information in the result set to generate the Compliance Recommendations and map the data to it, using the Compliance Recommendation Mapping family.
