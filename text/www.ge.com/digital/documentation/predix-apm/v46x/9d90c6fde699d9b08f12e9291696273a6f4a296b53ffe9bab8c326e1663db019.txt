Compliance ManagementDeploy Compliance ManagementThe checklists in this section of the documentation contain all the steps necessary for deploying and configuring this module whether you are deploying the module for the first time or upgrading from a previous version.Important: You must have an active license in Compliance Management, Inspection Management, and Policy Designer to use this module.Deploy Compliance Management for the First TimeBefore You Begin

The following table outlines the steps that you must complete to deploy and configure this module for the first time. 
                
These tasks may be completed by multiple people in your organization. GE Digital recommends, however, that the tasks be completed in the order in which they are listed.

Results
StepTaskNotes1Review the Compliance Management data model to determine which relationship definitions you will need to modify to include your custom equipment and location families. Via Configuration Manager, modify the relationship definitions as needed.
This step is required only if you store equipment and location information in families other than the baseline Equipment and Functional Location families.
2Assign users to the MI Inspection Security Group to provide privileges to the Compliance Management families.This step is required. 3
Assign Security Users to one or more of the Security Roles used in Compliance Management.

This step is required. 
Security Users will need permissions to the Compliance Management families before they can use the Compliance Management features.
4Create Inspection Strategy records using Record Manager. This step is required. You should create Compliance Strategy records that adhere to the compliance standards of a regulatory body that requires inspections.5Design a policy to use for a Compliance Strategy Template.This step is required. You can create this policy using the Policy Designer.6Create a query that will return the assets that you want to link to the Compliance Strategy Template.This step is optional. You can also add assets to the Compliance Strategy Template by individual asset.7Create a Compliance Strategy Template using the administrative features of Compliance Management. This step is required.8Link assets to the Compliance Strategy Template.This step is required.9Map the Policy to the Compliance Strategy Template that you created.This step is required.
Upgrade Compliance ManagementBefore You Begin

The following tables outline the steps that you must complete to upgrade this module to the latest version of GE Digital APM
                    .
                
These tasks may be completed by multiple people in your organization. We recommend, however, that the tasks be completed in the order in which they are listed.

After you upgrade to the latest version of GE Digital APM, following updates are automatically available: 
The MI Compliance Approver security role caption will be updated to MI Inspection Plan Approver.All security users who belong to the MI RBI Analyst security group will belong to the MI Inspection Plan Approver security role.The MI Inspection Plan Approver security role will have the MI ASM Analyst security group assigned. Compliance Recommendation Revision family will be renamed to Recommendation Revision. The datasheet for this family will be renamed to Recommendation Revision.The query Compliance Recommendation by Plan for Compliance will be renamed to Recommendation by Plan.The relationship family caption Has Compliance Recommendation will be updated to Inspection Plan Has Recommendation.
ProcedureUpgrade to the latest version of GE Digital APM.

The following table lists the baseline Security Groups available for users within this module, as well as the baseline Roles to which those Security Groups are assigned. In Predix APM, Roles are assigned to Security Users through permission sets.

Important:  Assigning a Security User to a Role grants that user the privileges associated with all of the Security Groups that are assigned to that Role. To avoid granting a Security User unintended privileges, before assigning a Security User to a Role, be sure to review all of the privileges associated with the Security Groups assigned to that Role.
