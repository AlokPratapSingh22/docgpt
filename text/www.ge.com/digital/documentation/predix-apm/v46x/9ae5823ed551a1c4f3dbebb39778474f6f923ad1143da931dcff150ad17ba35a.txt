Fuel Information Fields Fuel Information Fields
In addition to the fuel code fields, which define the fuel itself, Performance records use several fuel information fields to store information about how a fuel is used. Like fuel code fields, there is a separate set of fuel information fields for each fuel source.
For example, the Primary Quantity Burned field is used to identify how much of the primary fuel was used. Similarly, the Secondary Quantity Burned field identifies how much of the secondary fuel was used.
The following fields in the GAA Performance Fuel records, one for each fuel level, where <Fuel Level> is Primary and Secondary, depending on the fuel level for which the field exists:
Ash Softening TemperatureAverage Heat ContentGrindability IndexPercent AlkalinesPercent AshPercent MoisturePercent SulfurQuantity Burned
For example, consider the following image of the Performance Fuel tab of the baseline Performance datasheet.



When you specify a value in the Fuel Code cell, that value will be stored in the Fuel Code field. 
The corresponding fuel information fields are also displayed on this tab and contain information about the primary or secondary fuel, which is defined by the value in the Fuel Code field. These fields are not calculated automatically like most of the other fields in Performance records. You will need to collect this information outside of GE Digital APM and enter the correct values into these fields manually.
