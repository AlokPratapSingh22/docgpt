Table 2. Resolved IssuesNoteTracking ID(s)Previously, in the Cumulative Failures Plot section of the Analysis Summary page for a Reliability Growth analysis, if you were logged in to the GE Digital APM Unified environment as a Super User that was not part of either the MI Reliability User Security Group or the Mi Reliability Administrator Security Group, the Growth Options and the Analysis Tasks menus did not appear. This issue has been resolved. DE88466Previously, when creating a Reliability Growth analysis from a query, if the created analysis was assigned to a specific site, the site assignment did not properly restrict the source data to that site. As a result, all queried data was included in the Reliability Growth analysis, regardless of the site assignment. This issue has been resolved.DE86856Previously, when creating a new Reliability Distribution analysis, if you placed your cursor in the Analysis Name field and then pressed Tab to navigate to a different field, an error occurred. This issue has been resolved.DE84432Previously, when creating a Recommended Action, in the Target Completion Date field, if you selected a Target Completion Date that was prior to the current date, the Recommendation record was erroneously saved, and no error occurred. This issue has been resolved. Now, if you attempt to select a date in the Target Completion Date field that is prior to the current date, an error occurs as expected.DE83123Previously, when you accessed the report for a Reliability Growth Analysis based on costs, the fields in the Analysis Summary section were incorrectly labeled as failures. This issue has been resolved.DE80604Previously, when accessing an Asset Strategy Optimization Analysis from either Asset Strategy Management or from a System Reliability Analysis, in the Definitions section, if you modified the value in the Scenario Name field and then navigated away from the section, there was no indication that your changes were not saved. This issue has been resolved. Now, if you modify the value in the Scenario Name field and then navigate away from the Definitions section, a message appears, indicating that your changes have not yet been saved.DE78114
