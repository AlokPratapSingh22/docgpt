Analysis ChartsAbout Analysis ChartsAnalysis charts appear on cards contained in a view. Up to eight charts can exist on a card. Charts appear on an Alert Analysis or Analysis View and can be modified and saved as an Analysis Template. You can select or co-render multiple groups containing multiple charts.When a chart is saved as a template and added to an Alert Template, any triggered alerts appear in the Alerts module, where they can be examined.Analysis allows you to access private or public templates, or a new Time Series Analysis or Event Data Analysis view in the View Selector after you have chosen an asset context.Analysis allows you to access data of assets that are not available in GE Digital APM. You can upload a CSV or XLXS file containing data of assets using the New CSV Template. This data is used to create the appropriate tags in the Analysis Tag Browser. Using these tags you can plot charts to perform the CSV analysis.If you update or save a new template, the Context Ribbon appears, where you can change the template name, designate the template as public or private, and determine if the template is for an instance or a class.The selected configuration or the default value for the Time Zone (), Data Resolution (), Data Source (), System of Measure (), and Data Quality () drop-down list boxes appears for each settings option. You can select different options in these list boxes. These options are not available for SmartSignal charts.The default date range for an Alert Analysis has a start date seven days before the event date and an end date seven days after the event date. If the current date is earlier than the computed end date (seven days after event date), the end date defaults to the current date.The default date range for a Time Series Analysis View has a start date of 15 days before the current date.The Event Data Analysis View uses a selected number of events prior to a date and time selected by you to determine the time range for the selected event type. You can also select the number of seconds pre- and post-events to refine the amount of data surrounding the selected events.As you plot tags for an Alert Analysis View or a Time Series Analysis View, a Plotted Tags list appears in the Tag Tree Browser. The list appears as a hierarchy with nodes for cards and charts, and plotted tags or plotted tag series listed below. Event Data Analysis view chart types are limited to X-Y or Polar charts. After you have selected the number of events for an Event Data Analysis view, added two tags, and selected View Data, an Event Frames list appears in the Tag Tree Browser that contains the number of events selected. Each event is identified by a date and time, and is global for the all charts on the view. As you add cards and plot tags, a Plotted Tags list appears. Tags are represented below the main card node. You cannot manipulate tags in the Plotted Tags list. Muting and unmuting of data is controlled in the listed event frames, not the plotted tags. The Event Data Analysis View does not support multiple assets. The Timeline Slider beneath a chart allows narrowing of the time range on the x-axis without affecting the selected date range.Note: The Timeline Slider does not appear on an Event Data Analysis View.The asset, asset tag, and color depicted on the chart appear on the Chart Register. Scroll through the Chart Register to view plotted tags not immediately visible. Changing the time zone affects how the timestamp and time zone designation appears. The data values for the plotted tag on the chart appear when hovering over a colored line on the Chart Register.Note: The Chart Register does not appear on an Event Data Analysis View.The tag name, correlated tags, unit of measure, a description, and the asset appear on the Tag Information Table. Tag information is hidden by default. Note: The Tag Information Table does not appear on an Event Data Analysis View.You can select Sort by from Tag Register to execute the following actions: Sort by muted tags.Sort by tag name. Sort by value.You can select Pagination to execute the following actions: Use the left or right arrow to page through multiple pages.Show combined data. Select the arrow down or up to view in ascending or descending order.Show muted data.You can select  to execute the following actions:Show tag information.Add a chart below the selected chart.Modify a chart.Arrange a chart.You can select  to delete a chart. Adding a new chart to a card creates an empty chart below the selected chart.Note:
Selection of common chart controls such as zoom, cross-hair, and so on is applied across all the charts in a card and also across all the charts in any other card in the view. Any new charts added to the cards also retain the common chart controls selection made in one card. Deleting the chart or the card or moving to another card does not change the common chart controls selection. The sub configuration options of the common chart controls do not open for all the charts on which the selection is propogated.The common chart control selections are reset when you select another chart control outside the common controls and refresh the chart.When navigating to Analysis from an Alert, the selection of common chart controls is retained on the charts. The selection of common chart controls is retained on the Event Data Analysis charts.
Create a Time Series Analysis ChartUse Time Series Analysis to review data requests, or to create new analysis view templates.About This Task
You can select the type of ad hoc analysis charts with which you want to work. The Time Series Analysis uses time series data for the asset context you select. You can save a Time Series Analysis view as a template, which can then be applied to an Alert Template, triggering an alert in the Alert module.
You can add additional assets, add cards and charts, select a layout, change the date range, mute and unmute tags, plot tags, filter tags, plot tag expressions, and make other necessary modifications.
Note: Enable Timestamps mode to view one vertical and all horizontal lines on the chart. By default, Points mode is enabled that displays one vertical and one horizontal line on the chart.
You can create a new ad hoc analysis without saving the one on which you are currently working. When you navigate away from the current ad hoc analysis, a message appears, indicating that you will lose unsaved changes to the current ad hoc analysis view. Select Continue to create a new view with no tags plotted.Note: Consider saving the current ad hoc analysis as a template prior to navigating away.
ProcedureIn the module navigation menu, go to

Event Data Analysis allows you to compare the same event occurrence over time to see if it indicates a gradual degradation of an asset.
You can select the type of ad hoc analysis with which you want to work. The Event Data Analysis uses event-based data for the asset context you select. You can save an Event Data Analysis view as a template.Note: You cannot save an Event Data Analysis template to an Alert Template.
You can save an Event Data Analysis view as a template, which can then be applied to an Alert Template, triggering an alert in the Alerts module.
The Event Data Analysis charts rely on the selection of an Event Type. Event Types are garnered from Alert Types, which are created for Alert Templates during tenant on-boarding.
Just as with Time Series Analysis charts, you can add cards and charts, select a layout, mute and unmute events, plot tags, filter tags, plot tag expressions, and make other necessary modifications. Event Data Analysis charts are event-frame-centric instead of tag-centric. Event Frames are the timestamped, prior instances of the selected Event Type.
You can select the number of events in the charts, determine the number of seconds prior to and after each event, and determine the date and time ending the event search to appear. The default ending time is the present date and time.
If you change any of the settings for the charts, you must select Update to make the changes in the charts.
Event Data Analysis charts have some limitations:You cannot add multiple assets in the Tag Tree Browser, Tag Expressions or Search Browser panes.There is no Chart Register.There is no Timeline Slider below the chart.There is no Tag Information Table below the chart.You are limited to 40 events per tag.
Note: Enable Timestamps mode to view all vertical and all horizontal lines on the chart. By default, Points mode is enabled that displays one vertical and one horizontal line on the chart.
You can create a new ad hoc analysis without saving the one on which you are currently working. When you navigate away from the current ad hoc analysis, a message appears, indicating that you will lose unsaved changes to the current ad hoc analysis view.

A message appears on the chart indicating that the lasso filter is applied to the chart. If you navigate to analysis from alerts or cases and apply lasso filter selection to the data in the chart, you can save the selection state as an evidence to an alert or a case. You can access the chart evidence from the alert or case, modify the lasso filters and update the evidence, and save it again to the alert or case by overwriting the existing evidence or save it as a new evidence.You can filter data for lasso selections on a chart for selected time ranges, such that the selected data is visible in all the charts or excluded from the charts. The same time range is reflected on all the charts in a template.You can zoom the chart if the selected time range is at the beginning or end of the chart time range.The Lasso Filter Applied indicator appears for all charts in the card, that are synchronized when the lasso filter is applied.Upload a CSV fileYou can upload a CSV file with data using the New CSV Template that is available in the Analysis view templates drop-down list. About This Task
Using the CSV upload feature you can view data of assets that are not available in the APM server and visualize the data using the tags that are created for the uploaded data. 
The CSV file must contain the data in a specific format following certain conditions, without which the upload fails. Based on the data that is uploaded, the tags are created in the Analysis Tag Browser. The tags are used to plot and export charts to visualize the data. The following is a sample of the CSV file.
The CSV file must include the following data:Tag NameNote:
The tag name can include special characters.Each AssetName can be combined with the TagName, for example G12.DWATT.
Date and Time Data for each tag
The CSV file must meet the following conditions:The columns between the tag keywords and tag name must not be empty. All other columns can be empty.Some rows can be empty.The Tags and description keywords columns must have the timestamps for the tag data in the column that follows the tags.The Tag column names must be prefaced with the keyword Tag/Tags.The UoM column names must be prefaced with the keyword Unit/Units.The tag description column name must be prefaced with the keyword Description.The keyword prefixed rows must be prior to the timestamp data rows.The file format must be .csv or .xlsx. Row with a NaN timestamp is not considered.For an empty or a non-numeric data row, the column data for the tag is considered as NaN.

Note: When you upload an XLXS file, the timestamp that appears does not show the seconds and milli-seconds. Hence, if the timestamp values are required, you must format the values in the excel column and save it before you  upload the file. mm/dd/yyyy hh:mm:ss AM/PM is a sample format you can use to format the timestamp values.

ProcedureIn the module navigation menu, go to
Analysis.Use the Context Browser to select an asset context.In the View Selector, select the New CSV Template view.A File Upload window appears prompting you to select a data extract file.Select Choose File, browse through the files on the computer, select the .csv or .xlxs file you want to upload, and then select Apply.
 After the file is uploaded successfully, the CSV Visualization Asset appears in the Tag Browser.
