Fuel Code Fields Fuel Code Fields
The fuel code fields in Performance records correspond to the fuel code fields in GAA Unit records and are populated automatically with the corresponding values in the GAA Unit records to which they are linked.
In Performance records, fuel codes are stored within 16 distinct fields. While these fields appear as 16 separate cells on the Performance datasheet, the names of the cells do not correspond exactly to the names of the field captions. Throughout this documentation, we use the field captions when referring to these fields. Therefore, the following table maps the datasheet cell to the field caption.
