Data LoadersAbout the Inspection Management (IM) Data LoadersThe following Data Loaders are available in Inspection Management:Inspection Management (IM) Assets Data LoaderInspection Management (IM) Functional Location Data LoaderThroughout the documentation, these Data Loaders are collectively called the Inspection Management (IM) Data Loaders. You can use them to implement Inspection Management when you have inspection data in a legacy system. To import data using these Data Loaders, GE Digital APM provides the following Excel templates:
Inspection Management (IM) Assets.xlsx: Using this Data Loader, you can create or update Inspections and related records that are linked to Equipment records.
Inspection Management (IM) Functional Location.xlsx: Using this Data Loader, you can create or update Inspections and related records that are linked to Functional Location records. The data from the templates will be imported into GE Digital APM using the corresponding Data Loaders. Note:
The Excel templates are referred to throughout this documentation as the data loader workbooks.
You can use the data loader workbooks to create or update records in the following Inspection families:Inspection Confidence EvaluationInspection ProfileInspection MethodInspection TaskInspection (i.e., Bundle Inspection, Full Inspection, General Inspection, Pressure Test Inspection, and all types of Checklists)General FindingBundle Sub-InspectionPressure Test Sub-InspectionInspection RecommendationReference DocumentUsing the data loader workbooks, you can also create: Records that represent archived Inspections (i.e., inspections that have been completed and approved in the past). Since archived Inspections will be locked after creation, they cannot be updated using the data loader workbooks.Records of a custom sub inspection family that you may have created.The data on the (Picklist) worksheet is not loaded when you load data.Note:  A data load for Inspection Management is intended to be completed by an individual in your organization who has been designated as being responsible for importing and maintaining Inspections in GE Digital APM, usually an Inspector.About the Inspection Management (IM) Data Loaders RequirementsThis documentation assumes that your organization has fully completed the deployment of the Inspection Management module. The Inspection Management (IM) Data Loaders should only be used after the Inspection Management module has been implemented, and you have defined Site References, Functional Locations, and assets (Equipment records) for your organization.Human Resources and Resource Roles
The Inspection Management (IM) Data Loaders expect that individuals in your organization who will be performing and reviewing Inspections have one or more of the following Resource Role records linked to their Human Resource records:
Inspection SupervisorInspector
Certain privileges are required to complete a data load based on to whether inspections are (Active or Archived and the Status of the inspection Draft, Pending Approval, or Approved). Persons belonging to either the MI Inspection or the Data Loader User Security Group must:
... have the following Resource Role(s):...with inspections that are:...and inspections in the following Status:NotesNoneActiveDraftNoneInspector or Contract InspectorNote: The Contract Inspector must be assigned as a Team Member to request approval on the Inspection Report by updating the Status field.ActivePending ApprovalNoneInspector and Inspection Supervisor ArchivedApprovedThe Inspection Lock and the Final Inspection Lock are set to true.
Security Settings
The Security User performing the data load operation must be associated with either the MI Data Loader User or MI Data Loader Admin Security Role, and must also be associated with the MI Inspection Security Group, or a Security Role that is associated with this Security Group.
About the Inspection Management (IM) Data Loaders Inspection TypesThe Inspection Management (IM) Data Loaders can be used to load two different types of Inspections:
Active Inspections: Inspections that are still in the process of being completed or reviewed. After you load data, you can use the Inspection Management Bulk Approval feature to approve active inspections. Note:
If an inspection is currently downloaded for Inspection Field Data Collection, it cannot be updated through the data loader until it has been synced back.If the Use State Management for Inspection Recommendations check box in Application Settings is selected, Active Inspection Recommendations are loaded in the Proposed state. If it is cleared, Active Inspection Recommendations are loaded in the Created status. 

Archived Inspections: Inspections that have been reviewed, locked, and archived. Because of the nature of approving archived inspections, it is best for one person to perform this function. In the data loader workbooks, archived Inspections are those that have both the Inspection Lock and Final Inspection Lock fields set to True, and the Inspection Document Status field set to Approved. When an archived Inspection is loaded, the Inspection Report Owner and Reviewer’s Name fields will be set to the name of the user performing the data load. Note: If the Use State Management for Inspection Recommendations check box in Application Settings is selected, Archived Inspection Recommendations are loaded in the Completed state. If it is cleared, Archived Inspection Recommendations are loaded in the Implemented status. Important: When you transition the state of a loaded recommendation to the Completed state, if the state is unavailable, an error appears in the data loader log, stating an error occurred while attempting to set the state for the archived recommendation to MI_COMPLETED. Also, the recommendation will remain in the Proposed state.About the Inspection Management (IM) Data Loaders Data Model
This topic has been intentionally excluded from the GE Digital APM product documentation website. This topic is available to you via the product documentation that is provided within the GE Digital APM system.
About the Inspection Management (IM) Data Loaders General Loading StrategyPrerequisites
For Oracle databases, valid cell values are case-sensitive.The data loader workbook contains sample data in each column. It is only for your reference. You must remove this data before using the data loader workbook.
Best Practices
When importing data using the Inspection Management (IM) Data Loaders, you must use the following best practices:
ID fields (the second row on each worksheet) must not include special characters or spaces.Columns (including columns representing custom fields) on the worksheets should be formatted as Text.
When loading archived Inspections, you do not need to set values for the Inspection Report Owner and Reviewer’s Name cells. These fields will be set automatically to the name of the user who loads the data.
The supported date formats, time zone, and units of measure will be based on the user's settings.When creating ID numbers for loading inspection data, choose unique values.The value in the Inspection Reference field must be unique.
Load Sequence
The Inspection Management data load is performed in a specific sequence in order to create all necessary relationships between records:
The first step of the load sequence differs based on whether you are using the Inspection Management (IM) Assets Data Loader or the Inspection Management (IM) Functional Location Data Loader.If using the Inspection Management (IM) Assets Data Loader, the Assets worksheet is processed. An existing asset will be looked up based on values in the Equipment ID (MI_EQUIP000_EQUIP_ID_C), CMMS System (MI_EQUIP000_SAP_SYSTEM_C), and, if provided, Equipment Technical Number (MI_EQUIP000_EQUIP_TECH_NBR_C) cells.If using the Inspection Management (IM) Functional Location Data Loader, the Functional_Location worksheet is processed. An existing Functional Location will be looked up based on values in the Functional Location ID (MI_FNCLOC00_FNC_LOC_C) and CMMS System (MI_FNCLOC00_SAP_SYSTEM_C) cells.If an Asset or Functional Location specified on the respective worksheets does not exist, it will be skipped, along with all entries in the subsequent worksheets corresponding to that Asset or Functional Location.The Inspection_Profile worksheet is processed. For each row based on the cells specified in step 1, an Inspection Profile is looked up. If the Asset or Functional Location does not have a corresponding Inspection Profile, a new record will be created and linked.The Inspection_Method worksheet is processed. The assets or Functional Locations from step 1 and the Inspection Profiles from step 2 are considered, in addition to the following columns on the worksheet: Item Category (MI_PROFINSP_ITEM_CAT_C), Item ID (MI_PROFINSP_ITEM_ID_C), Method Category (MI_INSPMETH_ITEM_CAT_C), Method ID (MI_INSPMETH_ITEM_ID_C), and (only for assets) RBI Degradation Mechanism (MI_INSPMETH_DAMAGE_MECH_C).If a corresponding Inspection Method is not found, a new Inspection Method record will be created. Otherwise, the record will be updated The Inspection_Task worksheet is processed. The assets or Functional Locations from step 1 are considered as well as the following columns on the worksheet: Task ID (MI_TASK_ID), Reoccurring (MI_TASK_REOCC_FLG), and Override Interval (MI_TASK_OVERRIDE_INTER_F).If the Reoccurring cell is set to True, the Next Date cell cannot be specified because the task is reoccurring. As a result, the Next Date value will be automatically calculated.If the Override Interval cell is set to False, the setting of the Desired Interval cell by the data loader will not occur and the Desired Interval will be set to 0. Therefore, the Override Interval cell cannot be set to False.If the Override Interval cell is set to False, but the value in the Desired Interval cell is less than the value in the Minimum Interval cell, the Desired Interval will be set to the value of Minimum Interval.If the Reoccurring cell of the task is set to False, the Last Date and the Desired Interval cells cannot be specified. For tasks that are not set to reoccur, the following cells will not be copied from the data loader spreadsheet and they will have the following default settings:The Last Date cell will be empty.
The Desired Interval cell will be set to 0.
If logical cells (i.e. Override Interval, Reoccurring) do not have values, they will be set to True by default.The Inspections worksheet is processed. For each row based on the cells specified in step 1, as well as the Inspection Reference (MI_EVENT_ID) column, an Inspection. If no corresponding Inspection record is found, then a new record is created. Otherwise, the record will be updated.If the Inspection Document Status (MI_INSP_001_STATUS_INSP_C) cell is set to Approved and the Final Inspection Lock (MI_INSP_001_LOCK_FINAL_L) cell is set to True, the record will be considered an Archived Inspection. The Reviewer and Inspection Owner fields are automatically set to the user performing the data load.If the Inspection Task Complete field has been added as a column to the worksheet, and if values have been provided, an error message will be added to the log, and data in the columns will be skipped.If an existing Inspection is being updated via the data load, but the Inspection Lock field for the record is set to True, and:
...you are not the user designated in the Inspection Report Owner field, an error message will be added to the log and the Inspection will not be updated.
-or-

...you are the user designated in the Inspection Report Owner field, but the data being loaded via the Excel workbook does not set the corresponding Inspection Lock cell to False, an error message will be added to the log and the Inspection will not be updated.
The General_Finding worksheet is processed. Based on the fields in steps 1 and 5, and the Inspection Profile and Method, a General Finding record will be looked up. If the record is not found, then a new record is created. Otherwise, the record will be updated.The Inspection_Recommendation worksheet is processed. Based on the fields in steps 1 and 5, and the Recommendation ID (MI_REC_ID) column, an Inspection Recommendation is looked up. If a corresponding Inspection Recommendation is not found, then a new record is created. Otherwise, the record will be updated.If the Inspection Recommendation record is associated with an Archived Inspection, then the Author Name and Reviewer Name fields for the Inspection Recommendation record will be set to the user performing the data load.The Reference_Document worksheet is processed. Based on the field in step 5, and the Reference Document ID (CTIT_ID) column, a Reference Document is looked up. If a corresponding Reference Document is not found, then a new record is created. Otherwise, the record will be updated.The Bundle_Sub_Inspection, the Pres_Test_Sub_Inspection, and the Inspection_Confidence Worksheets are processed. Based on the field in step 5, and the Inspection Reference (MI_EVENT_SUB_INSP_ID) column, the related inspection is looked up. If a corresponding related sub-inspection record is not found, a new record will be created. Currently, the sub-inspection families that are supported by the Inspection Management (IM) Data Loaders are the Bundle Sub-Inspection and Pressure Test Sub-Inspection families.For the Bundle Sub-Inspection family, there are several combinations of column values which you cannot load and the combination of these column values will result in an error:
An error will be issued in the log if the value of the Action This Inspection column is set to NO ACTION and any of the following columns have a value:
Tubes Plugged During This InspectionTubes (Plugged At Start) Replaced
Tubes (Not Previously Plugged) Replaced


An error will be issued in the log if the value in the Action This Inspection cell is set to TUBES PLUGGED, TOTAL RETUBE, or BUNDLE REPLACED and any of the following columns are set to:

Tubes (Plugged At Start) Replaced

Tubes (Not Previously Plugged) Replaced
The column header for the sub-inspection Reference value will be different for each sub-inspection family, but will be similar to <Sub-Inspection Family Name> Reference.The value in the sub-inspection reference column will be stored in the Inspection Reference column of each created Sub-Inspection record. That column will be used for lookup when performing further loads.
The sub-inspection will be updated with the data given from the Inspection Management (IM) Data Loaders Template.



Since a relationship definition does not exist between the Bundle Sub-Inspection family and the General Inspection family, an error will be issued.
Note:  If the relationship definition is added between the Bundle Sub-Inspection family and the General Inspection family, the Bundle Sub Inspection family will load.

About the Inspection Management (IM) Data Loaders Workbook Layout and Use
To import data using the Inspection Management (IM) Data Loaders, GE Digital APM provides the following Excel workbooks:Inspection Management (IM) Assets.xlsx (for Inspections related to Equipment records)Inspection Management (IM) Functional Location.xlsx (for Inspections related to Functional Location records)
You must use these workbooks to load the data. You can modify the Excel workbooks to include custom fields used by your organization. Generally, your organization will use one of the two workbooks, but not both.
Note: The Excel workbooks are referred to throughout this documentation as the data loader workbooks.
The following table provides a list of worksheets that are included in the data loader workbooks. Unless otherwise specified, the worksheets appear in both the workbooks.

When you load data using the data loader, the data on this worksheet is not loaded.
Color Coding
Certain columns on the worksheets have different functions and requirements. To illustrate this, certain columns are color-coded. The following table lists the colors and what they represent.
ColorDescriptionCommentsGreyLookup FieldsIndicates columns that contain values that are used by the Inspection Management (IM) Data Loaders to look up and create records. If these columns are removed from the worksheets, the data load will fail. While the worksheets require that these columns be present, values are not necessarily required in these columns.RedFields Required for Saving RecordsIndicates columns that contain values that are required to save the record.BlueRecommended FieldsIndicates columns that, according to GE Digital APM Best Practice for Inspection Management, should contain values.GreenCustom FieldsIndicates columns in which you can specify custom fields.
Limitations
The Inspection Management (IM) Data Loaders have the following limitations:
The values that you enter in the data loader workbooks are case-sensitive.
When you use the data loader to update Inspection Management families:

If a cell contains data, the value in the corresponding field will be updated in the database. 

If a cell is blank, the value in the corresponding field will not be updated with a blank value in the database. The value that previously existed in the field is retained.


If you reimport data, the records that have been created by the Data Loaders will be updated. Therefore, while reimporting data, if you remove the data for a field in the data loader workbooks, the value for the corresponding field in GE Digital APM will be either a default value or blank.
Tip:  If you do not want to update a field value, you can remove the corresponding column from the data loader workbooks. You cannot, however, remove columns that correspond to required fields.

About the Inspection Management (IM) Data Loaders Load Verification
Following a data load, you should perform the following steps in GE Digital APM to confirm the integrity and accuracy of the data imported from the data loader workbooks:
Access the details of the import job. These details will indicate if any errors, minor or otherwise, were encountered during the import job. The log may help account for any records that are unexpectedly absent after the data load.In Inspection Management or Record Manager, access the assets or Functional Locations specified in the data loader workbooks, and then verify that the expected Inspection Profiles, Inspection Methods, and Inspections are present or updated, and that any associated records that you expected to be created are also present in the database.
