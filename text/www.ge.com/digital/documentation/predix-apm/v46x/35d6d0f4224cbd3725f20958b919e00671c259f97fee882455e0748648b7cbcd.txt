SmartSignal TemplatesEnable Y-Axis Ranges for SmartSignal ChartsYou can enable y-axis ranges and view y-axis min and max values on SmartSignal charts in a view. You can also set the limits on the analytics tags based on the modes. These limits are used when a mode tag is visualized in analysis.Before You Begin
You must set and ingest a chart limit for the relevant tags to view a chart using chart limits.You must set the options on your Analysis View to view Chart Limits or Autoscaling for your SmartSignal charts. The default option is to auto scale the charts, however, you can override this setting using the user preferences.
About This TaskAfter you plot your charts in SmartSignal, you can view the chart Y max and Y min for a tag. You can also view the Y-Min and Y-Max values for the tags when you hover over the tag in the tag browser.The following definitions may be helpful when selecting y-axis ranges:Chart LimitThe visual range of values that are plotted by default when the tag is plotted on a chart. If the data is beyond the range, you need to use the pan options on the chart to view the data which is outside the range on the chart. If the threshold falls inside the chart limit, the threshold line is visible on the chart. If the threshold falls outside of the chart limit, the threshold line will not be visible on the chart.Auto ScalingThe default setting for viewing SmartSignal charts. This setting allows you to view the chart using the data present on the selected date and time range.ProcedureNavigate to an analysis view using one of the following methods:
MethodActionNavigate from a SmartSignal Alert
In the module navigation menu, go to
Alerts.Select an Alert Inbox filter, such as Unclaimed or SmartSignal.Select an alert from the Alert Inbox.In the details page, select an Analysis View chart.Select  to expand the Tag Panel.

Use one of the following methods to enable chart limits or autoscaling:
MethodActionUse Chart Limits
Select , and then select Use Chart Limits.
If the tag that is plotted in the chart belongs to a mode, and the mode level Y-Min and Y-Max values are set, then the actual chart will scale using these values.If the mode level limits are not set, but the Y-Min and Y-Max are defined at the analytic tag level, then those settings are used to plot the chart.If none of the settings are set, then the charts will auto scale for that tag.
If the analytic tag have the Y-Min and Y-Max values configured, the residual charts for each tag will always use these values. If the analytic tag does not have the limits configured, the residual chart will auto scale in this option.
Use Auto Scaling
Select , and then select a date in the calendars, select a preset date range, or enter a date range. Select , and then select Use Auto Scaling.

The Y-axes for the plotted charts change to match your selections.Hover over a tag in the Plotted Tags section to view the Chart Y Max and Chart Y Min values.Enable Point Mode for SmartSignal CardsYou can enable point mode for SmartSignal cards, allowing the x-axis to display the number of data points selected instead of a date-time range.About This Task
When you enable point mode, the date on the calendar becomes the starting point. You can enter the number of data points for the charts in the card, and select the direction of the points from the starting date.Important: The number of data points that can be plotted to a chart is limited to 4000.
Plotted data points on a chart are connected in sequential order. Gaps are shown only when there is data that does not reflect a number.Tip:
When a .csv is exported, the data is generated for the data points plotted.You can save the view as a template.
