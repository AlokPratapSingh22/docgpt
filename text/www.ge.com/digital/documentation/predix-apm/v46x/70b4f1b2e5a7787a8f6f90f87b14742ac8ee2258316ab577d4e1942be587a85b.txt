This issue has been resolved. DE162905Previously, in the Tag Panel, when you attempted to update the value of a Value-Based Filter or a Conditional Filter, the Apply button was not disabled while the new value was loaded, which saved an incorrect value in the filter.

DE162905Previously, if you had set the visibility of an analysis template to one or more user groups, and then if you deleted the user groups, you were not able to reset the visibility permissions on the template. This issue has been resolved. Now, the template owner can reset the visibility permissions on the template.DE155201
