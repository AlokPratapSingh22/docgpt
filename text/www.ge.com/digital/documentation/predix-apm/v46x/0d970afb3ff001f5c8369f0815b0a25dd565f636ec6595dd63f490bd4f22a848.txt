Search BrowserAbout the Search BrowserUse the Search Browser to search for assets tags, and correlated tags for the enterprise.The Search Browser performs a deep search, allowing you to search through the enterprise asset tags, including child tags, using modifiers and search strings. A Search Help link is provided to allow selection of modifiers to construct your query:name: tag instance name.sourceKey: tag unique identifier.inContext: asset context.ofClass: tag classification name.<attributeName>: tag attribute value.
Note: The assetSourceKey, which is the assetID, is the default context prefix modifier that is used for unique searches. You can also use the assetName as the context prefix modifier if you want to search based on asset names.You can enter multiple search criteria based on the modifiers, adding them to the Search box. You can type the characters of the criteria or copy from another location and paste the characters in the Search box.You can also type special characters in the search criteria to search for tag names with special characters. Note:
When you type the special characters asterisk (*), colon(:), and backslash(\) in the Search box as part of the search criteria, you must type a backslash(\) before these characters to escape them. Else, the specific special characters are displayed as different characters than expected. However, when you copy and paste tag names with the specific special characters in the Search box, the backslash(\) is added before the specific characters by default. You do not have to add the backslash(\) before the special characters manually to escape them.  Wildcard search and usage of modifiers is not supported on the paste functionality for asset tags search.
The Search button is enabled only when any search criterion is added to the Search box. The Search button is disabled after the search is triggered until a new criterion is added or any existing criteria is modified.If you enter more than 10 search criteria, you can scroll down the Search box to view the criteria.Hovering over the search criteria chip displays an information tooltip prompting you to double click the chip to edit the search criteria or click  to clear the criteria. A maximum of 250 results is displayed at a time. You can select the maximum number of results to be displayed per page, 40 or 100, using the results per page drop-down list box. On the pagination toolbar, when the first page is selected  is disabled and when the last page is selected  is disabled.Tip: If your search returns more than 250 results, a hint appears to refine your search.If all the results appear on one page, the Select All  check box appears on the Search Browser. You can select all the tags from the search results to add to a chart, by selecting this check box.If the results appear on multiple pages, the Select Visible Tags check box appears on the Search Browser. You can select all the visible tags on the page to add to a chart by selecting this check box.The search results header displays the number of search results that are selected.Correlated tags and units of measure are displayed in the search results for a tag when available. Hovering over a tag or a correlated tag in the search results displays an information tooltip. Tooltip information is not displayed for nodes. Tags and correlated tags can be dragged to a chart for plotting.If you drag a tag associated with an asset that is not currently displayed in the Tag Tree Browser from the search results to a chart, that asset and its associated tags display in the Tag Tree Browser.You can select multiple tags from the search results to add to a chart, by using the Shift key or the Control key on the keyboard.
