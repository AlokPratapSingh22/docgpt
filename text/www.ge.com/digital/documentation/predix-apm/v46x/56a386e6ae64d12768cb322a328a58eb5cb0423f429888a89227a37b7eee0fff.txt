Data LoaderAbout the System Reliability Data LoaderThe System Reliability Data Loader allows both primary and third-party content to be delivered to GE Digital APM through the System Reliability Data Model. Using the System Reliability Data Loader, you can import the following types of primary and third-party data from a fixed-format Excel workbook into the System Reliability Data Model:System Analysis recordsSystem Scenario recordsSystem Subsystem recordsSystem Asset recordsSystem Buffer recordsSystem Link recordsSystem Switch recordsSystem Sensor recordsSystem Risk records System Action records System Risk Assessment recordsNote:  The System Reliability Data Loader will not be backwards compatible to earlier versions of GE Digital APM.About the System Reliability Data Loader RequirementsTo use the System Reliability Data Loader, your organization must have completed the deployment of the Reliability Analytics module.Security Settings
The Security User performing the data load operation must be associated with either the MI Data Loader User or MI Data Loader Admin Security Role, and must also be associated with the MI Reliability Administrator Security Group, the MI Reliability User Security Group, or a Security Role that is associated with this Security Group.
About the System Reliability Data Loader Data ModelSystem Reliability Data Loader Data Model
The following diagram shows how the families used in System Reliability Data Loader are related to one another.

Note: In the diagram, boxes represent entity families and arrows represent relationship families that are configured in the baseline database. You can determine the direction of each relationship definition from the direction of the arrow head: the box from which the arrow originates is the predecessor, and the box to which the arrow head points is the successor.
About the System Reliability Data Loader General Loading StrategyBest Practices
When importing data using the System Reliability Data Loader, you must use the following best practices:
ID fields (row 2 of each worksheet) must not include special characters or spaces.Columns in the worksheets should be formatted as either text or dates.The first two rows of each worksheet should not be edited.Only import a maximum of 500 analyses in each data load.
Limitations
This section documents a list of the limitations for the System Reliability Data Loader:
The user must use the System Reliability Data Loader workbook (System Reliability.xlsx). Any modifications made by the user to the values in column headings in any of the worksheets will not be imported.Note:  Any column values in a customized format will not be imported by the System Reliability Data Loader.If the user imports the same data multiple times, multiple analyses will be created.
