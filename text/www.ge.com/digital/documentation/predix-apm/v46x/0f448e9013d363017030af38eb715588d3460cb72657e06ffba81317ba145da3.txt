Offline FormsAbout Offline Forms
GE Digital APM customers can access data when executing product workflows offline. You can create, read, update, and delete GE Digital APM product data in a location without connecting to a server. Using Offline Forms, you can now modify and define an offline data collection UI for GE Digital APM families.Offline Forms can be accessed through Configuration Manager and the UI can be specifically configured for offline display. More than one offline form can be configured for a family. This form creation is available only for Entity Families. To configure a form, you can select a field from a list for the family and drag it onto a grid based canvas. Fields can be setup to occupy an entire row or you can have two fields in a row. The configuration will need to be exported and delivered as part of the Family content delivery.The following field behaviors are supported in offline forms:RequiredDisabledDefaultMasked FieldPicklistValidate (depends on the input type)Access the Offline Form BuilderProcedureAccess the Family Management Page.On the Family Management page, in the left pane, select Entity, and then select the entity whose datasheet you want to configure.The workspace for the selected entity family appears.In the workspace, select the Datasheets tab, and then select Manage Offline Forms.The Create New Form window appears.Note: If there is an existing offline form for the entity, the offline form for that entity appears.
