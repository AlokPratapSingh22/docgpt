RBI 581About RBI Data Loaders
GE Digital APM, through the Risk Based Inspection module, provides the functionality to carry out an RBI Analysis on various types of RBI components to calculate corrosion rate, and the probability and consequence of failure, and then develop intelligent strategies. Using the RBI Data Loaders, you can generate all components for a Process Unit along with the associated analyses.About the Risk Based Inspection (RBI) 581 Data LoaderUsing the Risk Based Inspection (RBI) 581 Data Loader, you can implement Risk Based Inspection when you have RBI data in a legacy system, which is not supported by GE Digital APM. To import data using the Risk Based Inspection (RBI) 581 Data Loader, GE Digital APM provides an Excel template, RBI_581_Data_Loader.xlsx, which supports baseline Risk Based Inspection GE Digital APM. You must export your legacy system so that the data can be used to populate the template. The data from the template will then be imported into GE Digital APM using the Risk Based Inspection (RBI) 581 Data Loader. Note:  The Excel template is referred to throughout this documentation as the data loader workbook. The data loader workbook can be used in the following scenarios: Create or update componentsCreate or update analysesLoading components and risk analysis data into GE Digital APM so that you can retain visibility into the analysis details and calculations, and generate recommendations.Calculate risk, probability and consequence of failure, and then utilize the Inspection Planning feature to mitigate the risk by the plan date.After importing the data, the Risk Based Inspection (RBI) 581 Data Loader creates the following records in GE Digital APM:Criticality Calculator RBI ComponentRBI 581 Risk Analysis RBI Consequence EvaluationRBI 581 Thinning and Lining EvaluationRBI 581 External Damage EvaluationRBI 581 External Cracking Damage EvaluationRBI 581 Cracking Damage EvaluationRBI 581 HTHA Damage EvaluationRBI 581 Brittle Fracture Damage EvaluationYou cannot, however, create RBI 581 Mechanical Fatigue Damage Evaluation records using the Risk Based Inspection (RBI) 581 Data Loader.The data on the (Picklist) worksheet is not loaded when you load data using the Risk Based Inspection (RBI) 581 Data Loader.Note:  This data loader workbook is not backward compatible to earlier versions of GE Digital APM.About the Risk Based Inspection (RBI) 581 Data Loader RequirementsBefore you use the Risk Based Inspection (RBI) 581 Data Loader, you must complete the following steps:Ensure that the RBI 581 module is deployed.
Ensure that the following data is present:Site ReferenceEquipment TaxonomyEquipment and Functional Location FamiliesRBI Data MappingUnits of Measure Conversion Sets
Stress Tables (GE Digital APM provides Stress Tables for Pressure Vessels and Tanks. If you want to use values from these Stress Tables with the data load, you must ensure that the records are imported into your database prior to performing the data load. GE Digital APM does not provide Piping Stress Tables).
Representative Fluids
If you have added custom fields to Risk Mapping families (e.g., RBI Risk Matrix Mapping, Risk Analysis Mapping), you must ensure that mappings exist for those fields, or data may not be populated as expected after the data load. This is because the Risk Based Inspection (RBI) 581 Data Loader relies on Risk Mapping families to ensure that fields on RBI 581 Risk Analysis and related records are correctly populated with data, and that resulting risk values can be mapped to the Default Risk Matrix.The Security User performing the data load operation must be associated with either the MI Data Loader User or MI Data Loader Admin Security Role, and must also be associated with the MI RBI Analyst Security Group or a Security Role that is associated with this Security Group.The data loader workbook contains sample data in each column. It is only for your reference. You must remove this data before using the data loader workbook.About the Risk Based Inspection (RBI) 581 Data Loader Data Model
This topic has been intentionally excluded from the GE Digital APM product documentation website. This topic is available to you via the product documentation that is provided within the GE Digital APM system.
About the Risk Based Inspection (RBI) 581 Data Loader General Loading Strategy The imported data must load in a specific sequence in order to successfully populate fields, to create records, and to link them to the predecessor and/or successor records. Best Practices
When importing data using the Risk Based Inspection (RBI) 581 Data Loader, you must use the following best practices:
 ID fields must not include special characters or spaces.Columns (including columns representing custom fields) in the worksheets should be formatted as Text.Import a maximum of 500 assets in each data load. The maximum number of records that you can load per asset using the data loader is specified in the Best Practices for Loading a Single Asset topic.Do not try to create and update a component in the same data loader workbook.Ensure that you enter values in cells that correspond to fields required to calculate an analysis. Otherwise, warnings will be issued in the log for the analysis and related records with invalid data.When a field whose value is required based on the value in another field is blank, a warning is logged in the log file of the import job.You must consider the rules described in the Workbook Layout and Use section of this document while using the Risk Based Inspection (RBI) 581 Data Loader.If you have entered data related to an analysis or a DME, then you must always enter data of the associated component in the RBI_Component worksheet, even if the corresponding Criticality Calculator RBI Component record exists in the GE Digital APM database.You must enter a valid value in the following cells in the RBI_Component worksheet; Otherwise, the row that corresponds to that component is skipped:Component IDComponent Type Process FluidNote: If the value is left blank, a valid value must be provided for each associated RBI 581 Risk Analyses.GFF Component Type Note: If the value is left blank, a valid value must be provided for each associated RBI 581 Risk Analyses.
When you use the data loader to create an analysis and a cell that requires a Boolean value is blank, the corresponding field in GE Digital APM is updated with the value False. When you use the data loader to update an analysis and a cell that requires a Boolean value is blank, the corresponding field in GE Digital APM is not updated. Therefore, to avoid ambiguity, we recommend that you enter the valueTrue or False in the cell and not leave it blank. 
If you want to override the default values that you have specified in the 
RBI 581 Admin Options
 workspace, you can include those values in the Risk Based Inspection (RBI) 581 Data Loader. For example, if the value for the Atmospheric Condition field for an RBI 581 External Damage Evaluation record is set to Temperate in the RBI 581 Admin Options workspace. You can override this value by entering a different value in the Atmospheric Condition cell in the DME_ExternalDamage worksheet. If you want to override values that are populated from the associated component, you can include those values in the Risk Based Inspection (RBI) 581 Data Loader. For example, the value for the Operating Temperature field in an RBI 581 Risk Analysis is populated from the corresponding field in the associated RBI Component. If you want to override this value for the analysis, you must include a column for Operating Temperature in the RBI_581_Analysis worksheet in the data loader workbook, and enter the value in that cell.
In addition to the fields included in the Risk Based Inspection (RBI) 581 Data Loader, if you want to add values for more fields for a record, you can add columns for those fields in the appropriate worksheet. 
Note:  The fields that you want to add to the data loader workbook must already exist in the corresponding family. If not, you must add the fields to the family via Configuration Manager. 
You should not add columns that correspond to fields in the Outputs and Intermediate Outputs sections of a datasheet; Otherwise, the calculations might not be correct. You should not add a column that corresponds to the Use Combined Confidence and Use Related Inspection fields to any of the following worksheets:
DME_Thinning
DME_ExternalCracking
DME_Cracking
The Use Combined Confidence field is part of the integration of the Risk Based Inspection and Inspection Management modules. A value should only be set in GE Digital APM.

Load Sequence
The data is loaded in the following sequence in order to create all necessary relationships between records:

The Assets worksheet is processed. The Data Loader searches for the asset that corresponds to the Asset ID, Asset CMMS System, Equipment Technical Number (only for an Equipment asset) and Asset Family information that you provide in the Assets worksheet. 
If an asset specified on the worksheet does not exist, it will be skipped, as well as all entries in the subsequent worksheets corresponding to that asset.

The RBI_Component worksheet is processed. The Data Loader searches for the RBI Component based on the asset data and the values in the Component and Component Type cells.
If a component exists in the GE Digital APM database, it will be updated. If not, a new component will be created, and linked to the asset.

The RBI 581 Analysis worksheet is processed. For each row based on the cells specified in steps 1 and 2, a new analysis is created and linked to that component. You cannot update an analysis using the data loader workbook. The value in the Analysis Unique ID cell is not stored but will be used to identify all the Degradation Mechanism Evaluations and Consequence Evaluations specified on the subsequent worksheets that should be linked to the analysis. 
If there is invalid data for calculating an analysis, the analysis will still be loaded, but warnings will be issued in the log for all fields with incorrect values.
The RBI 581 Consequence worksheet is processed. For each row based on the cells specified in steps 1 to 3, a Consequence Evaluation is created, and linked to the specified analysis.
The worksheets representing Degradation Mechanism Evaluations are processed. For each row based on the cells specified in steps 1 to 3, a Degradation Mechanism Evaluation is created, and linked to the specified analysis. Additionally, for each Damage Mechanism, a corresponding Potential Degradation Mechanism is created, and linked to the component, unless a Potential Degradation Mechanism of the same type is already linked to the same component.
When the Degradation Mechanism Evaluations are processed, if you have not included a Degradation Mechanism in the worksheet that corresponds to an existing Potential Degradation Mechanism on the component, that Potential Degradation Mechanism will be unlinked.

Data that you specify in the cells on each worksheet will be included in the records. Additionally, fields in the records will be populated with data based on your RBI Data Mapping. For example, an RBI 581 Risk Analysis will be populated with data from the RBI Component to which it is linked the same way it happens if you create the same records in GE Digital APM.
Best Practices for Loading a Single AssetFor optimal performance, we recommend that you load a maximum of 14 Components with three DMEs each or 9 Components with seven DMEs. To avoid performance degradation of the data loader, you must maintain the total number of records within this limit. If you want to load more number of DMEs, you must reduce the maximum number of components.The following tables provide illustrations of the maximum number of records that you can load per Component or Analysis, as applicable. It also provides the maximum total number of records that you can load per Asset.Important: The numbers shown in the table are for reference purpose only, and not the maximum number of records that the data loader is designed to load. These numbers are derived based on the test results obtained from the labortory machines. However, the performance of the data loader may vary based on the database server configuration, application server configuration, load on the servers, network speed, and other performance factors. If you find a degration in the data loader performance, we recommend that you reduce the number of records in a single batch and upload the records in multiple batches.Record NameAn example of the maximum number of records you can load per Asset/Component/AnalysisAn example of the total number of records you can load per AssetRBI Component9 per Asset9RBI 581 Risk Analysis1 per Component9RBI 581 Consequence Evaluation1 per Analysis9Internal DME1 per Analysis9External DME1 per Analysis9Cracking DME1 per Analysis9Lining DME1 per Analysis9External Cracking DME1 per Analysis9HTHA DME1 per Analysis9Brittle Fracture DME1 per Analysis9Total number of records90About the Risk Based Inspection (RBI) 581 Data Loader Workbook Layout and Use

Limitations
The Risk Based Inspection (RBI) 581 Data Loader has the following limitations:
You must use the data loader workbook. If you modify the format of the values in columns in any of the worksheets, you will not be able to import data.Components of the Heat Exchanger - Bundle type are not supported as part of the baseline GE Digital APM, but you can enter data related to the component.The values that you enter in the data loader workbook are case-sensitive.You cannot import data related to a custom DME using the Risk Based Inspection (RBI) 581 Data Loader. You must import only those DMEs that are included in the data loader workbook.
If you reimport data, the records that have been created by the Data Loader will be updated. Therefore, while reimporting data, if you remove the data for a field in the data loader workbook, the value for the corresponding field in GE Digital APM will be blank.
 You cannot create Inventory Group Configuration records, or link a Component to an inventory group using the data loader workbook. 
When you use the data loader to update an RBI 581 Analysis and the associated Consequence Evaluation, Damage Mechanisms, and Damage Mechanism Evaluations:
If a cell contains data, the value in the corresponding field will be updated in the database. If a cell is blank, the value in the corresponding field will not be updated with a blank value in the database. The value that previously existed in the field is retained.
You cannot delete the Consequence Evaluation and the Degradation Mechanism Evaluations associated with an RBI Analysis using the data loader.You cannot update a What-If analysis using the data loader.
Assets Worksheet
In the Assets worksheet, you will specify assets to which you want to link components. The columns that appear on this worksheet also appear on every subsequent worksheet, and are used to identify the records that will be linked, directly or indirectly, to the assets.
