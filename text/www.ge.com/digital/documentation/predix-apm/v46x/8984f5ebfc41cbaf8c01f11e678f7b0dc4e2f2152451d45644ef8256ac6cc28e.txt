About Potential Degradation Mechanisms (PDM)
Potential Degradation Mechanisms (PDM) records are used to represent ways in which a component might fail (e.g., mechanical fatigue). These records can be linked to RBI Components and are used to predict and prevent mechanical failure. Each Potential Degradation Mechanisms record that is linked to a Corrosion Loop represents a degradation mechanism, or a way in which the components in that Corrosion Loop might fail.
After a Corrosion Loop is linked to PDMs, as you link RBI Components to the Corrosion Loop, those RBI Components will be linked automatically to all of the Potential Degradation Mechanisms that are linked to the Corrosion Loop. Each PDM that is linked to an RBI Component represents a way in which that component can fail.
Baseline Potential Degradation Mechanisms (PDMs)

GE Digital APM provides several quantitative Potential Degradation Mechanisms.

All of the PDMs apply to RBI Components. 

GE Digital APM provides the following Potential Degradation Mechanisms:
581-885F Embrittlement581-Acid Sour Water Corrosion581-Alkaline Carbonate Stress Corrosion Cracking581-Alkaline Sour Water Corrosion581-Amine Corrosion581-Amine Cracking581-Atmospheric Tank Bottom Corrosion581-Austenitic Component Atmospheric Cracking581-Austenitic Component Cracking Under Insulation581-Brittle Fracture581-Caustic Cracking581-Chloride Stress Corrosion Cracking581-Cooling Water Corrosion581-Ferritic Component Atmospheric Corrosion581-Ferritic Component Corrosion Under Insulation581-HIC/SOHIC - H2S581-HIC/SOHIC - HF581-High Temperature H2/H2S Corrosion581-High Temperature Hydrogen Attack581-High Temperature Oxidation581-High Temperature Sulfidic and Napthenic Acid581-Hydrochloric Acid Corrosion581-Hdrofluoric Acid Corrosion581-Hydrogen Stress Cracking581-Internal Component Lining Damage581-Low Alloy Steel Embrittlement581-Other Cracking581-Piping Mechanical Fatigue581-Polythionic Acid Cracking581-Sigma Phase Embrittlement581-Soil Side Corrosion581-Sulfide Stress Cracking581-Sulfuric Acid Corrosion
Valid Fluids for an RBI 581 Risk Analysis
This topic provides a list of valid representative fluids and toxic fluids for RBI 581. On the datasheet of an RBI 581 Risk Analysis, in the Representative Fluid and Toxic Model boxes, if you select a fluid that is not valid for RBI 581, an error message appears when you calculate the analysis. 
When you select a Representative Fluid that is valid for RBI 581, the Fluid Valid for 581 Analysis check box is selected, indicating that you have selected a valid fluid. Similarly, when you select a toxic model that is valid for RBI 581, the Toxic Fluid Valid for 581 Analysis check box is selected, indicating that you have selected a valid toxic fluid.

RBI Risk Matrix Mapping
Note: The RBI Risk Matrix Mapping family supports RBI 581 Risk Analyses. These mappings support only the default Risk Matrix.
 The records in the RBI Risk Matrix Mapping family are used to specify which Policies are used to populate the default Risk Matrix, using data contained in RBI 581 Risk Analyses and related records. The information in the following table reflects the baseline state and behavior of fields that exist in the RBI Risk Matrix Mapping family.

RBI 581 Security Groups

The following table lists the baseline Security Groups available for users within this module, as well as the baseline Roles to which those Security Groups are assigned. In Predix APM, Roles are assigned to Security Users through permission sets.

Important:  Assigning a Security User to a Role grants that user the privileges associated with all of the Security Groups that are assigned to that Role. To avoid granting a Security User unintended privileges, before assigning a Security User to a Role, be sure to review all of the privileges associated with the Security Groups assigned to that Role.

Note:  Security privileges for all modules and catalog folders can be found in the APM documentation. 
The following families are not used elsewhere in the RBI module. Privileges to these families support integration with the Inspection Management module:
Has Inspection ScopeHas Time Based Inspection IntervalTime Based Inspection IntervalTime Based Inspection Setting
Specifically, certain features of the Time-Based Inspection Settings functionality, which you can use if the Inspection Management license is active, are facilitated by these privileges.
State Management for Inspection PlansThe following state changes can be applied to the Inspection Plans based on user Security Roles.
The diagram below shows the workflow of the baseline State Management process as it applies to Inspection Plans. 
Details
The Proposed state is the initial state of all Inspection Plans.When you change the state of an Inspection Plan from Approved to Modified, an Inspection Plan Revision History record is created.
Reserved States and Operations for Inspection Plans
The following tables indicate whether the baseline states and operations are reserved. You cannot remove or modify reserved states or operations.

RBI 581 Risk Analysis State Assignments and Operations
The RBI 581 Risk Analysis uses specific states and operations from the baseline State Assignments of GE Digital APM. 
In RBI, State Configuration is used in the following families:
RBI 581 Risk AnalysesRBI Recommendations
RBI State Assignments and Operations DiagramNotice that the some of the states are highlighted in Green. When an RBI Criticality Analysis is set to any of these states, the analysis is active. When an RBI Criticality Analysis is set to any of the states highlighted in Red, the analysis is inactive.Additionally, in the diagram, you can see dotted lines and black lines.Dotted lines represent operations that are performed automatically when another RBI Criticality Analysis that is linked to the same RBI Component is set to Risk Completed.Black lines represent operations that you can perform manually.Note:  While the preceding image includes the Reject operation and the Rejected state, this state and operation are not valid in the RBI workflow and are, therefore, colored gray in the image. While they exist in the baseline State Configuration, if you try to reject an RBI 581 Risk Analysis, an error message appears, indicating that this operation is not valid. Details
Initial State: The Created state is the initial state of all new RBI 581 Risk Analyses.
Datasheet Configuration: By default, states and operations will appear on the datasheet when you are viewing an RBI 581 Risk Analysis in RBI, the Record Manager, or the Bulk Data Form.
Reserved States and Operations: The following tables state whether or not the baseline states and operations are reserved. You cannot remove or modify reserved states or operations. You can, however, add your own states and operations to the State Assignment.

If an RBI 581 Risk Analysis is set to Risk Completed, however, the value in the Mitigated Risk field in the RBI Degradation Mechanism to which it is linked can be modified. 
RBI Site Filtering The RBI Component family, and all the families that are linked to it, use the GE Digital APM Site Control. You can access or modify only the records in RBI that are assigned to the same site to which you are assigned. Important: You cannot modify the site assignment for a record within the RBI user interface. You can change the site assignment by accessing an RBI record in Record Manager. Since it may lead to data integrity issues, however, RBI Best Practices warn against changing site assignments on created records.
Site Filtering
Consider an organization that has three sites, Site X, Site Y, and Site Z. 
 Scenario 1: User assigned to only Site X. 
This user can access or modify records that are linked to assets only in Site X. However, this user can access all the Potential Degradation Mechanisms in the database.
 Scenario 2: User assigned to only Site X and Site Y. 
This user can access or modify records that are linked to assets only in Site X or Site Y. However, this user can access all the Potential Degradation Mechanisms in the database.
 Scenario 3: Super User 
This user can access or modify records that are linked to assets in Site X, Site Y, or Site Z.
