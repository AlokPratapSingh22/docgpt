StepTaskNotes
1

Assign Security Users to one or more of the Security Roles used in IM.

This step is required. 
Security Users will need permissions to the Inspection Management families before they can use the Inspection Management features.
2Assign Resource Roles to users.
This step is required to define the users who can perform Inspection workflows as Inspectors, supervisors, administrators, contract inspectors, and risk analysts in Inspection Management.
3Modify baseline Application Configuration settings.This step is required only if you want to modify Application Configurations. The following Application Configurations are defined in the baseline database: Asset Query Path; Associated Relationship Family; Published Query Path; Summary Query Path; Alerts Query Path; Asset Is Successor; Profile Configuration; Method Configuration; Strategy Rule Configuration. 4
Define the Inspection Profile for each piece of equipment that you will inspect.This step is required only if you plan to create Inspection records in baseline families other than the Checklists subfamilies.5Modify the baseline Asset query.
This step is required only if you want Inspection records to be linked to records in a family other than the Equipment family.6
Define Event Configurations for any new Inspection families that you have created.This step is required only if you have created custom Inspection families that you want to use within Inspection Management.7Create a Checklist Configuration Template for custom inspections.This step is optional.8Define Taxonomy Configurations for Inspection Families and Checklist Configurations.This step is required only if you want to link Inspection Families and Checklist Configurations to assets using equipment taxonomy.9
Assign certifications to users.This step is optional.10
Group inspection work into Work Packs.This step is optional.
Upgrade Inspection ManagementBefore You Begin

The following tables outline the steps that you must complete to upgrade this module to the latest version of GE Digital APM
                    .
                
These tasks may be completed by multiple people in your organization. We recommend, however, that the tasks be completed in the order in which they are listed.

Note: If you are using Inspection Field Data Collection for Offline Inspections, please follow the upgrade steps to install the latest app on mobile devices used for Inspection Field Data Collection.
After you upgrade:
A new Human Resource role, Contract Inspector (ID: CONTRACT INSPECTOR) is now available in MI_RESOURCE_ROLE system code table. This is to facilitate the enhancement where a Contract Inspector can now update the Status field in Inspection records to Pending Approval without being the user defined in the Inspection Report Owner field if they are also a Team Member in the associated Inspection record.
ProcedureUpgrade to the latest version of GE Digital APM.

The following table lists the baseline Security Groups available for users within this module, as well as the baseline Roles to which those Security Groups are assigned. In Predix APM, Roles are assigned to Security Users through permission sets.

Important:  Assigning a Security User to a Role grants that user the privileges associated with all of the Security Groups that are assigned to that Role. To avoid granting a Security User unintended privileges, before assigning a Security User to a Role, be sure to review all of the privileges associated with the Security Groups assigned to that Role.

Note:  Security privileges for all modules and catalog folders can be found in the APM documentation.

Note that:
The family-level privileges granted to the following families are also spread to all of their subfamilies:EventTaxonomy References The Has Task History relationship family is inactive in the baseline GE Digital APM database.In addition to the families listed in the preceding table, members of the MI Inspection Security Group have View privileges to additional families to facilitate integration with the Risk Based Inspection module. Since these families are not used elsewhere in Inspection Management, they are not listed in this table.
Note: As part of implementing Inspection Management, you will decide whether you want to link Inspection records to Equipment records, Functional Location records, or both. If you want to link Inspection records to Functional Location records, you will need to grant members of the MI Inspection Security Group at least View privileges to the Functional Location family and the Functional Location Has Equipment relationship family. All new users are automatically assigned to the Everyone user group.
