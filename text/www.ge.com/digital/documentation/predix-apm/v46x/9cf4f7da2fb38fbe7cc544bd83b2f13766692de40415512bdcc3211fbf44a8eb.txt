You can use an existing template's cards as a building block when building new templates. Sharing cards allows you to take the existing cards in a template and add them to the new template so you can create new templates faster.
When you share a card on a view, you can apply it to one or more public or private Analysis Templates selected by you. Analysis Templates with shared cards can then be viewed, modified, and associated with an Alert Template. Analysis Templates that have modified cards affect existing associations with Alert Templates.
The name of the shared card can be modified prior to sharing, but cannot be left blank. Shared cards contain the charts, layout, and tags plotted, including tag expressions, but do not include any filter settings for the tags.
You can select from private templates and public templates associated with the selected asset context, both instance and class, as templates to which to add your selected card. Templates with successfully shared cards are available for additional card sharing.Note: It is possible for templates with shared cards to contain cards with the same name. Consider modifying the card name on the receiving template after it has been shared.
