RBI PoliciesRBI PoliciesAn RBI Policy allows you to develop and execute strategies based on historical data and dynamic data, which is obtained by monitoring conditions in real time. The policies used in RBI are categorized as follows:
Policies used to calculate an analysis 

Policies used to generate recommendations

Policies used in risk mapping
These policies appear in the Module Workflow Policies section of the Policy Designer Overview page.Policies used to Calculate an RBI 581 Risk Analysis
This topic provides a list of Policies used by each family in RBI 581 to calculate an RBI 581 Risk Analysis.
