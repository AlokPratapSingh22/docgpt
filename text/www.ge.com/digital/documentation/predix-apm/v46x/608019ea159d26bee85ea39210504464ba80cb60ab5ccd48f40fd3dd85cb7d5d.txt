Table 2. Resolved Issues
The following issues that existed in one or more previous versions have been resolved.
DescriptionTracking IDPreviously, for a Criticality RBI Component - Exchanger Bundle, when you copied an RBI Criticality Analysis or created a What-If Analysis from an RBI Criticality Analysis, and then calculated the analysis, the Final Phase and Final Phase Shell Side fields in the related Criticality Consequence Evaluation record were not populated. This issue has been resolved.DE117340Previously, the value in the Desired Interval field in an Inspection Task was recalculated when the related RBI Recommendation was either deleted or transitioned to the Archived state. This issue has been resolved.DE117062Previously, when calculating inventory for the Criticality RBI Component – Cylindrical Shell component that contained the value Storage Tank in the Component Type field, an error occurred. This issue has been resolved. Now, the Calculated Inventory field is populated with the correct inventory value.DE100794Previously, when you attempted to finalize risk of multiple analyses that belonged to multiple Assets or Corrosion Loops, the operation failed completely when there were multiple analyses that belonged to a single component. This issue has been resolved. Now, in this scenario, the analyses that belong to different components are updated to Risk Completed and an error message appears to indicate the number of failed analyses.DE95713Previously, you could unexpectedly modify unmitigated risk values on Failure Risks with a source of RBI in Asset Strategy Manager (ASM). This issue has been resolved.DE83069

Table 4. Enhancements and New Features
The following enhancements and new features have been added.
DescriptionTracking IDTo enhance usability of the Risk Based Inspection (RBI) 580 Data Loader, the following values are now updated in the Interface Log record generated by the data loader:Number of Record Processed: This value is incremented by one for each asset processed by the data loader.Number of Records Rejected: This value is incremented by one for each RBI Criticality Analysis record that encounters an error when processed by the data loader, thus resulting in the record not being created or updated.Number of Records Created: This value is incremented by one for each RBI Criticality Analysis record that is created.Number of Records Updated: This value is incremented by one for each existing RBI Criticality Analysis record that is updated.US366675To enhance usability, in the RBI Recommendation, the value in the RBI Recommendation Methodology field has been changed from Criticality Calculator to RBI 580.US353694To enhance usability when using a UOM conversion set, the values within numeric fields are rounded off according to the type of the numeric field as follows:
Numeric Field TypeNumber of Decimal PlacesPressure, Temperature, Stress, Length, Diameter, Area, Mass, Percent, Age, Cost, Risk2Thickness, Corrosion Rate, Damage Factor4Probability of Failure
Exponential if value is less than 1 8 decimal places if value is greater than 1

 This change is applicable to the fields from the following families:All RBI Component FamiliesRBI Criticality AnalysisRBI Consequence EvaluationCriticality Int. Corr. Deg. Mech. Eval.Criticality Ext. Corr. Deg. Mech. Eval.RBI Degradation MechanismsUS352458The properties of the following representative fluids that are valid for RBI Criticality Analysis have been updated as per the API 581, 3rd Edition, Addendum 1 specification:C13-16 (Diesel)C17-25 (Gas Oil)C25+ (Resid)C5ChlorineCOEOH2H2O (Water)H2SHClHFMEOH (Methanol)NH3PhosgeneSteamUS349921
Table 5. Resolved Issues
The following issues that existed in one or more previous versions have been resolved.
DescriptionTracking IDPreviously, if the Override Minimum Required Thickness check box was selected for an RBI Criticality Analysis, the value specified in the Specified Tmin box was not considered while calculating the Estimated Half-Life for the Criticality Calculator External Corrosion Degradation Mechanism Evaluation. This issue has been resolved.DE117296Previously, in the Risk Based Inspection (RBI) 580 Data Loader template, in the Consequence_Evaluation worksheet, the Consequence field contained the default value RBI. Due to this, an error occurred when importing data using the data loader. Now, the default value in the Consequence field has been changed to RBI Consequence.Note: The error message that appears when importing data using the Risk Based Inspection (RBI) 580 Data Loader that contains an invalid value in the Consequence field has now been updated to include the invalid value and the associated Analysis ID.DE111087
Previously, in Criticality Calculator RBI Components, the value in the Calculated Inventory field was rounded off to the nearest whole number. Due to this behavior, if the value in the Calculated Inventory field was less than or equal to 0.5, the value was rounded off to 0, which resulted in incorrect calculations. This issue has been resolved. Now, the calculated inventory field displays up to two decimal values.
A similar change has been made to the Inventory field in the Criticality Consequence Evaluation and Criticality Calculator RBI Components.
DE107865Previously, the Material Grade boxes in the records of the following families contained incorrect values:Piping StressRBI ComponentsRBI Criticality AnalysisThis issue has been resolved. Now, the correct values appear in the Material Grade boxes, as specified in the following table.
