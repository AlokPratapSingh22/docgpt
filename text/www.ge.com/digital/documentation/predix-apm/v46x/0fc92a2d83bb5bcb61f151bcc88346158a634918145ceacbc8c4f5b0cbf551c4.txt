Inspection PlansAbout Inspection PlansAn Inspection Plan can be created from any asset that is linked to a Compliance Strategy Template and meets the requirements of Compliance Strategy records in the policy that is associated with the Compliance Strategy Template.When an MI Compliance Administrator creates a Compliance Strategy Template, the completed template has linked assets. From this point, an MI Compliance Analyst or MI Inspection Plan Approver can generate an Inspection Plan based on the policy that is mapped to the Compliance Strategy Template. Alternatively, users can get suggested Compliance Strategy Templates for assets; MI Compliance Analysts can apply Compliance Strategy Templates to these assets and create Inspection Plans from the Compliance Management Overview page. An Inspection Plan is attached to the asset from which it is generated, and the user can view the details of the Inspection Plan from Compliance Management. The Inspection Plan contains Compliance Recommendations and displays Inspection Tasks for an asset. When the Inspection Plan is moved to the Approved state by an MI Inspection Plan Approver, users then can create or link an Inspection Task to the Compliance Recommendation. When the Compliance Recommendations have Inspection Tasks linked, the Inspection Plan is fully integrated with the Inspection Management module. For more information on Security Roles and Inspection Plans, see Compliance Management Security Roles.About Inspection Plan ApprovalAn MI Inspection Plan Approver can approve Inspection Plans that are created by the MI Compliance Analyst. Approving an Inspection Plan will also integrate the related asset with Asset Strategy Manager (ASM).Compliance Recommendations are used to create Actions. For more information on ASM Integration, see, About Asset Strategy Management (ASM) Integration.MI Compliance Analysts can review and modify the Inspection Plan if more changes are needed.After an Inspection Plan is created, the MI Inspection Plan Approver and MI Compliance Analysts can review the plan and modify existing Compliance Recommendations. The MI Inspection Plan Approver can move the Inspection Plan to the Approved state. When the Inspection Plan is in the Approved state, users can create or link Inspection Tasks to the Compliance Recommendations based on the application setting. If the MI Inspection Plan Approver or an MI Compliance Analyst is no longer satisfied by the items contained in the Inspection Plan, they can update the Inspection Plan, which moves the Inspection Plan back to the Modified state. The MI Inspection Plan Approver can then delete, mark as not required, or supersede Compliance Recommendations. Each time the Inspection Plan is changed from the Approved to the Modified state, an Inspection Plan Revision record is created and linked to the existing Inspection Plan. For each existing Compliance Recommendation record, a Recommendation Revision record is created and linked to the Inspection Plan Revision. In addition, the Inspection Plan must be returned to the Approved state by the MI Inspection Plan Approver before they can re-promote it to ASM. About Modifying Compliance Recommendations on an Inspection PlanAn MI Compliance Analyst or MI Inspection Plan Approver can modify Compliance Recommendations if they want to modify an Inspection Plan.An Inspection Plan should be modified in the following scenarios:A policy that is used in a Compliance Strategy Template is modified.The Compliance Strategy records that are associated with a policy that is mapped to a Compliance Strategy Template are modified.Modifying Compliance Recommendations on an Approved Inspection Plan
