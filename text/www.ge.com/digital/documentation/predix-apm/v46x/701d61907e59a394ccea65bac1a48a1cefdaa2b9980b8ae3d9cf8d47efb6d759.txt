QuestionsAbout QuestionsIn MOC, a Checklist is presented as a list of questions. These questions must be designed such that they identify all relevant impact areas of the change and action items that must be completed for a smooth implementation of the change. Questions must take into consideration various aspects of the change, such as the technical feasibility of the change and its impact on safety. In the Application Settings for MOC, you can configure a Question with two or more Answer Options. Each Question can be configured to have only one Exception. The Checklist Questions that you created in the Application Settings for MOC are used as a template when adding a Checklist to a Change Project. When you respond to Questions in MOC, based on your configuration for Answer Options, Exceptions are created automatically.Default Questions in MoC
By default, GE Digital APM provides a set of Questions. These Questions are also associated with Answer Options that are linked to the default Exceptions. The following table lists the default Questions and the associated Answer Options, which you can modify as needed:
