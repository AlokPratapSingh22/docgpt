General Reference An Example of a Root Cause Analysis
The sections in this topic correspond to each step in the workflow for developing a Root Cause Analysis. In each section, the workflow for creating an RCA will be illustrated through examining the recurring failure(s) of a cooling water pump. The data used in each of the sections is listed in tables. In the tables, we list only the fields that contain a value. In the case of numeric fields, this includes fields that contain a value of zero (0). Fields that contain no value are not listed in the tables. The information in tables is provided for your reference. 
Note: The information contained in these topics assumes that you are the user who will be performing the associated step in Root Cause Analysis and that all RCA administrative tasks have been completed.
Define criteria for when an RCA should be performed
Before you can begin conducting an RCA, you must establish the criteria that standardizes when an RCA should be performed. For example, the manager of the plant, where a cooling water pump exists, might specify criteria as: 

 If any pump fails one or more times per week for more than two successive weeks, regardless of the cost for repairs, an RCA study should be conducted. 
-or-
 If any pump fails catastrophically (e.g., causes the system to shut off), an RCA should be conducted. 
Now, assume that in January 2015, the bearing temperature alarm, on the outboard bearing of a cooling water pump, sounded. By the time the operator arrived, the motor bearing temperature had increased to a point that the protective bearing temperature circuit caused the pump to shut down, resulting in loss of production. According to the criteria that was developed, these conditions dictate that an RCA should be performed. The first step is to create the analysis. 
Create an RCA
If water pump failure meets the criteria for requiring an RCA, the first step is to create the analysis. The user who will serve as the Principal Analyst can complete this step and initiate the development of the RCA for the recurring failures of the cooling water pump.

Access the RCA Overview page.

In the upper-right corner of the page, select New Analysis.
A blank datasheet appears in the Analysis Summary workspace. 




Enter the values in the fields on the datasheet. For this example, you should create root cause analysis that contains the information as it appears in the following table:

In the workspace, select the Definition tab.The Definition section appears.In the Charter field, enter the following text: To identify the root causes of the cooling water pump failure. This includes identifying deficiencies in or lack of management systems. Necessary recommendations for root causes will be communicated to the management for rapid resolutions. Select .The Charter field is updated.
Preserve Failure Event Data
You can preserve failure event data by creating an RCA Preserve Record, which contains a data-collection task that should be completed by the team member to whom the Preserve Record is assigned. Each task can be categorized according to the 5 P's (i.e., Parts, Paper, People, Position, Paradigms), which indicates the type of data that should be collected.
In the left pane, select the Preserve Records tab.The Preserve Records workspace appears. In the upper-left corner of the workspace, select . The New Preserve Record window appears.

After each team member has collected the data that is specified in the RCA Preserve Record, they should record their findings for the rest of the team through artifacts, including Reference Documents and hard copies of documents. After all the RCA Preserve Records have been completed, the team can begin to analyze the data. 
Analyzing data
After the team has preserved the failure data, the team can begin to analyze the data. To help you visualize the event and organize the team's hypotheses and analysis, you should create an Event Diagram or a Logic Tree depending on your requirement. For our example, we will create a Logic Tree diagram.
In the left pane, select the Logic Tree tab.A blank datasheet appears.

Enter the following values:
FieldValue (s)Event End Date 01/15/2018Event ID 
RCA-01/15/2018
Note: The Event ID field is populated automatically with the date the is created and is disabled so that value cannot be changed. If you choose to re-create this example RCA Event, your Event ID value will be different from the value listed here. 
Event Start Date 01/06/2018 Label Overheating in Pump 1 Long Description Investigate the cause of a cooling water pump to overheat and shut down the system. 
Select .The Failure Event node appears in the design canvas in the Logic Tree workspace.In the upper portion of the workspace, in the Palette section, select , and then use the drag-and-drop method to add the icon to the Failure Event node in the design canvas.Select the Failure Mode that you added. The Properties window appears.Enter the following information to define the Failure Mode, and then select :
RCA Failure Mode ID Value (s)No Spare Parts 

Label: No Spare Parts 

Description: No spare parts caused the pump to be out of commission for a longer amount of time. 

Add another Failure Mode using the following information:
RCA Failure Mode ID Value (s)Motor tripped due to high temperature. 

Label: Motor tripped due to high temperature.

Description: The motor shut off because the temperature became too hot and the system was shut down.

Diagram the events that led up to and immediately followed the failure event. For this example, you would create the Event Diagram as shown in the following image. The team should note the trend in the failures that occurred in the past. In this way, the team may be able to identify a pattern in the events prior to the RCA that may indicate the underlying cause(s) for these failures.

This example contains nine RCA Sequence Nodes, which are displayed on the Event Diagram. Sequence Nodes in Event DiagramFor each RCA Sequence Node, the following table lists the type of node and the values that exist in the RCA Sequence Node.

Diagram each failure mode in detail. For this example, you would create a Logic Tree like the one shown in the following image:

In the Logic Tree in this image, you can see that two Failure Mode nodes are linked to the Failure Event node, and multiple Hypothesis nodes are linked to the Motor Tripped due to high temperature Failure Mode node.This example contains four RCA Logic Gates, which represent Logic Gate nodes and are used in the Logic Tree. You must enable Logic Gates to view them on the Logic Tree. Example Data in Logic GatesIn the following table, the Logic Gates are numbered as they appear in the Logic Tree from left to right. For each RCA Logic Gate, the table displays the value in the Gate Type field of the RCA Logic Gate and identifying information about the node (e.g., RCA Failure Mode) to which it is linked.

Now that several likely hypotheses have been introduced, the team will need to rule out hypotheses. To rule out a hypothesis or prove a hypothesis, the hypothesis will need to be tested against the data that is available to the team (i.e., the failure event data and the team of experts).As described in the next step, the Principal Analyst should create RCA Verifications and assign them to team members who will be responsible for completing the associated task.
Select the Hypothesis that you want to verify. In the lower-left corner of the workspace, select the Verifications tab.The Verifications pane appears. Above the list, select . The Create Verification pane appears.In the Assigned to list, select the team member to whom you want to assign the Verification.A blank datasheet appears.Enter the details in the available fields based on the following information to define each of the Verification required for our example, and then select .
 RCA Verification ID  Values Specified Inspect wiring to make sure that the cause was not electrical.

Due Date: 1/10/2015 

Method: Inspect wiring to make sure that the cause was not electrical. 

Completed: No
Perform a metallurgical analysis to determine why the bearing failed.

Due Date: 1/10/2015 

Method: Perform a metallurgical analysis to determine why the bearing failed. 

Completed: False

The following image shows an example of an RCA Verification that contains a task to test the Mechanical hypothesis. 

The task defined in this RCA Verification instructs the team member to inspect the wiring for the cooling water pump to ensure that the problem was not electrical, but mechanical.When a hypothesis has been tested, you must change the state of the associated RCA Hypothesis, as described in the next step.
Select the Hypothesis whose state you want to change.At the top of the workspace, in the States panel, select one of the following options, and then select :
Hypothesis True if the hypothesis has been confirmed. After you determine a hypothesis to be true, you can identify the root cause of the Failure Event.
Hypothesis Not True if the hypothesis has been ruled out.
For example, the following image shows the Logic Tree after Pete Handy has completed the RCA Verification to which he was assigned. Pete Handy concluded that the wiring did not the cause the pump to overheat, so the problem must be mechanical.



After the state of the Mechanical RCA Hypothesis is set to True, the team can continue down the Logic Tree until they identify the root cause. Causes can be further identified as physical, human, or latent. For example, the following image shows the Logic Tree after ALL the RCA Verifications have been completed. The team has concluded that inadequate accountability of workers has led to insufficient lubricant being applied to the outboard bearing, which caused the motor's temperature to increase and the pump to overheat.



In this case, the root cause for the pump failure would be identified as latent (i.e., inadequate accountability of workers), which lead to human (i.e., too little applied) and physical (i.e., lubrication issue) causes. Now that a hypothesis has been verified and the root cause has been determined, you can create RCA Recommendations to communicate your findings on how to prevent this failure in the future.
If the hypothesis is not true but you cannot rule out the hypothesis and set the state to False, you can assign a probability to the hypothesis to include the team in determining the possibility of the hypothetical cause.

Communicating findings and recommendations
Now that the team has determined the root cause of the cooling water pump failure to be inadequate accountability of workers, you will want to record your findings and create RCA Recommendations. After recommendations have been implemented, you can share the results of the RCA with others. You can access the RCA Overview page to view the financial effects of implementing the recommendations. For our example, we will create one Recommendation record.

Access the Root Cause Analysis for which you want to create a recommendation.In the upper-right corner the workspace, select the .The Recommendations pane appears.Select . The RCA Recommendation datasheet appears. On the General Information tab, enter the following details in the available fields:

If you want to schedule a recommendation alert email to be sent to a specified recipient, select the Alert tab, and enter the necessary information on the datasheet.Select .The RCA Recommendation is saved to the database and linked to the analysis for the selected Root Cause analysis.
After you have successfully identified the root causes associated with the failure that was investigated, you can communicate the findings and propose recommendations to the appropriate individuals within your organization. You can communicate the findings via a hyperlink to the analysis or via a summary report through email to selected recipients.
Tracking Results
After the RCA findings have been communicated and the recommendation has been implemented, the team will want to track the effectiveness of the recommendation to see if the new report has prevented the cooling water pump from failing thus far. Tracking for results involves creating RCA Tracking Items, scheduling the Tracking Evaluations in the GE Digital APM Schedule Manager, and modifying the existing recommendation or creating a new one based on the discoveries that are made through reevaluation.
For our example, we will create one tracking item.

Access the RCA within which you want to create a new Tracking Item.In the left pane, select the Track tab.The Track workspace appears.

RCA Data Model
The Root Cause Analysis data model uses families to represent the various components of an RCA, as defined by the standard, accepted PROACT for RCA methodology. GE Digital APM leverages its fundamental entity and relationship family infrastructure to store data related to an RCA.
Each RCA is represented at the root level by an RCA. The RCA can be linked to an RCA Event through the RCA Relationship. RCA Events can, in turn, be linked to RCA Failure Modes, RCA Sequence Nodes, and so on for all components of the RCA. Together, the RCA and all the records that are linked to it, either directly or indirectly, make up the Root Cause Analysis.
The following image shows the entity families and relationship families that are used to create an RCA.



Note: In the diagram, boxes represent entity families and arrows represent relationship families that are configured in the baseline database. You can determine the direction of the each relationship definition from the direction of the arrow head: the box from which the arrow originates is the predecessor, and the box to which the arrow head points is the successor.
Note: RCA Recommendations can be linked to any Equipment and any Functional Location. They may or may not be the same Equipment or Functional Locations that are linked to the RCA.
The Root Cause Analysis Best Practice specifies that you will create RCA Analyses either for equipment or functional locations. Either option may be valid, depending on the analysis. Throughout the RCA documentation, we assume that you are following the GE Digital APM best practice and storing your equipment and functional location information in Equipment and Functional Location records. Additionally, we assume that you are following the RCA Best Practice and linking your RCA records to either Equipment or Functional Location records.
In addition to the relationships that appear in this image, records in the following families can be linked to records in the RCA Reference Document family through a relationship definition on the Has Reference Documents family:
RCA Analysis RCA Critical Success Factor RCA Event RCA Failure Mode RCA Preserve Item RCA Recommendation RCA Team Member RCA Tracking Item RCA Verification 
Additionally, the following families are used by the RCA module but are not related to any other family in the data model:
The RCA Image family is used to display an image of the Event Diagram and the Logic Tree in the Comprehensive Analysis Report.The Alert family is used to send alert emails.
RCA Security Groups

The following table lists the baseline Security Groups available for users within this module, as well as the baseline Roles to which those Security Groups are assigned. In Predix APM, Roles are assigned to Security Users through permission sets.

Important:  Assigning a Security User to a Role grants that user the privileges associated with all of the Security Groups that are assigned to that Role. To avoid granting a Security User unintended privileges, before assigning a Security User to a Role, be sure to review all of the privileges associated with the Security Groups assigned to that Role.

Tip: For more information, refer to the Site Filtering section of the documentation.

In RCA, users will see only Root Cause Analyses that are assigned to their site(s) or that are global records. In the Linked Assets section for a Root Cause Analysis, users will see all of the assets linked to the Root Cause Analysis, but will only be able to access those assets to which they have the necessary permissions.
Note: RCA Templates are designated as global records.
Example
Consider an organization that has three sites, Site X, Site Y, and Site Z. The following RCA Analysis records exist:
RCA Analysis A: Assigned to Site XRCA Analysis B: Assigned to Site YRCA Analysis C: Assigned to Site ZRCA Analysis D: No site assigned (global record)
 Scenario 1: User assigned to only Site X 
This user will see RCA Analysis A and RCA Analysis D.
 Scenario 2: User assigned to both Site X and Site Y 
This user will see RCA Analyses A, B and D.
 Scenario 3: Super User 
This will see RCA Analyses A, B, C and D.
Important: If a multi-site user, or a Super User, links child records from multiple sites to a parent record designated as Global, another user who does not have access to all sites may only see a portion of the data associated with that record. In the example above, if a child record assigned to Site X and a child record assigned to Site Y are linked to RCA Analysis D, the Site X user will not be able to see all the records associated with RCA Analysis D.
