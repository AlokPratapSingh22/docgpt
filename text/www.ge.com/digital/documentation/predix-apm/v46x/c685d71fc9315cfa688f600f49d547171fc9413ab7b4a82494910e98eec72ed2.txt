Release Notes
Second Quarter of 2020







Second Quarter of 2020Release Date: May 8, 2020This topic provides a list of product changes released for this module on this date.RBI 580 and 581

Table 1. Resolved Issues
The following issues, which existed in one or more previous versions, have been resolved.
DescriptionTracking IDPreviously, on the Risk Based Overview page, in the Assets section, when you selected Finalize Risk button, the PRD analyses did not appear. This issue has been resolved.US399824 Previously, if you updated any of the Global Preferences in the RBI Admin Preferences page, the RBI Overview Table Preference was cleared and the selected columns were no longer displayed for RBI 580 or RBI 581. This issue has been resolved. Now, editing Global Preferences will not affect a previously saved RBI Overview Table Preference.DE127917Previously, in RBI Corrosion Loop datasheet and RBI System datasheet, the Created By and Last Updated By fields were not populated. This issue has been resolved.DE121950Previously, in the Degradation Mechanisms section, the horizontal scroll bar overlapped with the last row of the grid. This issue has been resolved. Now, the scroll bar appears at the bottom of the section.DE119942Previously, in the Inspection Plan page, if the RBI Recommendations were in a Proposed state and did not have a baseline state ID, the following buttons were not enabled or disabled correctly:SupersedeNot RequiredDeleteThis issue has been resolved.DE119883Previously, when generating recommendations in Risk Based Inspection (RBI), if the Name of a policy used for strategy mapping was longer than 50 characters, an error occurred. This error was due to the length of the Policy Name field in RBI Strategy Mapping Configuration family being configured to less than the length of the Name field in the Policy family. This issue has been resolved. Now, the length of the Policy Name field in RBI Strategy Mapping Configuration family and the Name field in Policy Family are the same.DE116375

RBI 580

Table 2. Enhancements and New Features
The following enhancements and new features have been added.
DescriptionTracking IDYou can now calculate the RBI PRD Criticality Analyses in bulk from the Assets section of the following pages:Risk Based Inspection OverviewUnit SummaryCorrosion LoopUS398540Previously, all families were included in the global search. Now all families from Risk Based Inspection (RBI) 580 have been excluded from the global search except the following:Equipment TypesRepresentative FluidsPiping StressPV StressTank StressPotential Degradation MechanismsAll Analysis familiesAll Component familiesNote: You can use search configuration to enable or disable Global Search for families.

Table 3. Resolved Issues
The following issues, which existed in one or more previous versions, have been resolved.
DescriptionTracking IDPreviously, if both the Risk Based Inspection (RBI) and RBI 581 licenses were not applied in the Risk Based Inspection module, when using the Upgrade Analyses utility from the RBI Admin Preferences page, an error occurred. This issue has been resolved.DE123165Previously, when calculating an RBI Criticality Analysis, the value in the Estimated Half Life field in the Criticality Ext. Corr. Deg. Mech. Eval. family was set incorrectly if you had defined UOM conversion set for any field used for the calculation of estimated half-life. This issue has been resolved. DE119596Previously, if your culture setting had a culture other than English, and you linked a Degradation Mechanism to an RBI Criticality Analysis, the values contained in the following boxes of the Degradation Mechanism record were not translated to the language based on your culture setting:Deg Mech Comments Degradation Mechanism DescriptionThis issue has been resolved. Additionally, the Deg Mech Comments box now does not contain any value by default.DE93275Previously, when generating recommendation on an RBI Criticality Analysis linked to a Wet H2S (Blistering, SOHIC, HIC, SSC) Degradation Mechanism, the Appendix _G policy was not executed. This issue has been resolved.DE82211

RBI 581

Table 4. Enhancements and New Features
The following enhancements and new features have been added.
DescriptionTracking IDPreviously, all families were included in the global search. Now all families from Risk Based Inspection (RBI) 581 have been excluded from the global search except the following:Equipment TypesRepresentative FluidsPiping StressPV StressTank StressPotential Degradation MechanismsAll Analysis familiesAll Component familiesNote: You can use search configuration to enable or disable Global Search for families.US395686The Non-Flammable Non-Toxic (NFNT) Consequence Area calculations for caustic and acid fluids have been modified to adhere to the API-581 3rd Edition, Addendum 1.US384625
Table 5. Resolved Issues
The following issues, which existed in one or more previous versions, have been resolved.
DescriptionTracking IDPreviously, when calculating the mitigated risk on the plan date for External Cracking Degradation Mechanism Evaluation on an RBI 581 Risk Analysis, the age calculation did not consider the Target Inspection Date. As a result, the Total Damage Factor With Plan (RBI Degradation Mechanisms) displayed incorrect values for the following damage mechanisms:581-Austenitic Component Atmospheric Cracking581-Austenitic Component Cracking Under InsulationThis issue has been resolved.DE128159Previously, when the value in the Liner is Present field was set to Yes (Y), and Degradation Mechanism Evaluation (DME) was not 581-Internal Component Lining Damage, the Online Monitoring Adjustment field in RBI 581 Thinning and Lining Damage Mechanism Evaluation record was incorrectly calculated. This affected the value in the Final Damage Factor field. This issue has been resolved.DE125927Previously, when the Allow Override of Total Financial Consequence field was set to true on RBI 581 Consequence Evaluation records, the User Total Financial Consequence field was incorrectly excluded for the calculation of financial risks on the related RBI Degradation Mechanisms (DMs) records. The User Total Financial Consequence field was also excluded from RBI 581 ISO-Risk Plot. This issue has been resolved.DE123065Previously, when you calculated an RBI 581 Risk Analysis on a Storage Tank component that contained a toxic mixture, the calculation failed. This issue has been resolved.DE121404
Previously, when the UOM conversion set was assigned to you, while calculating an RBI 581 Risk Analysis, the Risk Category field was calculated incorrectly. In addition, the output fields were calculated incorrectly for any of the following conditions:The component type was Storage Tank or Storage Tank Bottom.The analysis contained a Brittle Fracture damage mechanism evaluation.
This issue has been resolved.
DE121778Previously, when you viewed the RBI 581 ISO-Risk Plot Preferences page on a low-resolution device, the RBI 581 ISO-Risk Plot Medium-High Category Limit field was not visible if the browser was zoomed to 100 percent. This issue has been resolved.DE118013Previously, if your culture setting had a culture other than English, and you linked a Degradation Mechanism to an RBI 581 Risk Analysis, the values contained in the following boxes of the Degradation Mechanism record were not translated to the language based on your culture setting:Deg Mech Comments Degradation Mechanism DescriptionThis issue has been resolved. Additionally, the Deg Mech Comments box now does not contain any value by default.DE93275
