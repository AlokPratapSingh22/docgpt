StepTaskNotes
1
Assign Security Users to one or more of the Security Roles used in TM.
This step is required.
User must have permissions to the TM families in order to use the TM functionality.
2Assign Resource Roles to users by performing the following steps:Access the Human Resource record for each user.In the Role box, select TM Technician.
This step is required to allow a user (typically, a TM Inspector) to enter details in an Inspection record.
3

Configure Family Preference Application Settings.

This step is required. 
You must configure preferences for the families that will be used to store equipment data in Thickness Monitoring.
The following relationships must be defined:
For the Equipment family, the Asset to Subcomponent Relationship field must be set to Has TML Group, and the Component ID field must be set to Equipment ID. The Subcomponent to Asset Relationship field should be left blank.For the TML Group family, the Subcomponent to Asset Relationship field must be set to Has TML Group, and the Component ID field must be set to TML Group ID. The Asset to Subcomponent Relationship field should be left blank.
4

Configure Global Preference Application Settings.
This step is required only if you want to use custom reading preferences and Nominal T-Min preferences. Baseline reading preferences and Nominal T-Min preferences will be used if you do not define your own. You can also define additional, optional global preferences that are not defined in the baseline GE Digital APM database.5
Define additional fields that will be displayed in the header section of the TM Measurement Data Entry.
This step is required only if default Thickness Measurement fields are displayed on the headings of these pages in the baseline GE Digital APM database. You can specify that additional fields be displayed in the header section of these pages.6
Disable the Auto Manage Tasks setting.
This step is required only if you are planning to use TM tasks.7
Install the Meridium Device Service on all of the machines that will connect to devices that will be used with Thickness Monitoring.This step is required only if you will use any device to collect data that you transfer to Thickness Monitoring. If you are using HTTPS to connect to GE Digital APM, follow the instructions in https://ge-ip.my.salesforce.com/kA20h0000009SCN?srPos=0&srKp=ka2&lang=en_US. 8Install the drivers and supporting files for any devices on all of the machines that will connect to devices that will be used with Thickness Monitoring.This step is required only if you will use these devices to collect data that you transfer to Thickness Monitoring.

This step is optional.5Update PV Stress content and stress lookup fields for Thickness Measurement Locations for Non-Piping Assets.This step is required only if you want to use the Pressure Vessel stress content with updated Material Grade in accordance with Tables 1A and 1B of ASME Section II, Part D, 2010. For more information, refer to KBA 000038584.6Update the datasheet of Thickness Measurement Location family by adding the Minimum Thickness Type Field.
If you have customized the default datasheet of the Thickness Measurement Location family and want to see the Minimum Thickness Type data, you must do the following:Using the Family Management, edit the default datasheet of MI Thickness Measurement Location family. Remove the existing Minimum Thickness Type (Obsolete) field and add the Minimum Thickness Type field in the Datasheet.
7Update the datasheet of Thickness Monitoring Rules Lookup family by adding the T-Min Formula Policy Field.
If you have customized the default datasheet of Thickness Monitoring Rules Lookup family and want to see the T-Min Formula Policy data, you must do the following:Using the Family Management, edit the default datasheet of Thickness Monitoring Rules Lookup family. Add the T-Min Formula Policy field in the Datasheet.
8Update the values in the newly added Minimum Thickness Type field from the existing Minimum Thickness Type (Obsolete) field.
This will be automatically done by a Utility during an upgrade process. User does not need to do anything.

GE Digital APM provides the following baseline Security Groups for use with Thickness Monitoring and provides baseline family-level privileges for these groups:
MI Thickness Monitoring AdministratorMI Thickness Monitoring InspectorMI Thickness Monitoring User
Access to certain functions in GE Digital APM is determined by membership in these Security Groups. Note that in addition to the baseline family-level privileges that exist for these Security Groups, users will also need at least View privileges for all customer-defined predecessor or successor families that participate in the Thickness Monitoring relationships. Keep in mind that:
Users who will need to create new records in TM will need Insert privileges to these families.Users who will need to modify records will need Update privileges to these families.Any user who should be allowed to delete TM records will need Delete privileges to these families.
The following table summarizes the functional privileges associated with each group.

TM Security Groups

The following table lists the baseline Security Groups available for users within this module, as well as the baseline Roles to which those Security Groups are assigned. In Predix APM, Roles are assigned to Security Users through permission sets.

Important:  Assigning a Security User to a Role grants that user the privileges associated with all of the Security Groups that are assigned to that Role. To avoid granting a Security User unintended privileges, before assigning a Security User to a Role, be sure to review all of the privileges associated with the Security Groups assigned to that Role.
