Inactive Hours Field Inactive Hours Field
The GE Digital APM system calculates the time between the values in the Event Start Date and the Event End Date fields in each Primary Event record and stores it in the Event Duration field of the Primary Event record. The value in the Event Duration field will be used to populate the Inactive Hours field in the Performance record that is linked to the Primary Event record if the Capacity Event Type field in the Primary Event record contains one of the following values:
IR (Inactive Reserve) MB (Mothballed) RU (Retired) 
If multiple Primary Event records are linked to a Performance record, then the sum of the values in the Event Duration field in all Primary Event records will be used as the total event duration. This calculated value is then used to populate the Inactive Hours field.
Consider the following example.
 Primary Event - IR (Inactive Reserve ) Primary Event - M (Mothball ) Primary Event - RU (Retired) Event Start 01/01/2016 12:00 AM 01/02/2016 12:00 AM 01/03/2016 12:00 AM Event End 01/02/2016 12:00 AM 01/03/2016 12:00 AM 01/04/2016 12:00 AM 
In this example, the event duration for each Primary Event record is 24 hours. In the Performance record for January 2016 for the GAA Unit record to which these three Primary Event records are linked, the Inactive Hours field would contain the sum of the duration of these three events, or 72 hours.
