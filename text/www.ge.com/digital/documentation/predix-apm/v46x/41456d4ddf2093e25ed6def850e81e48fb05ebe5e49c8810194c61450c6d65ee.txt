RBI Analysis ExportAbout RBI Analysis ExportRBI Analysis Export workspace allows you to view analyses that can be exported with the related asset and component data. You can export the data in the RBI data loader template format for easy data modification and re-importing.Note: When exporting the existing analyses and component data in the RBI Analysis Export section, the (Picklist) sheet in the RBI data loader template is excluded. To reference the valid values for picklist fields, you can download the RBI data loader template in the Data Loaders workspace.When to Export

Export is useful when you want to evergreen or re-assess existing analyses based on triggers such as time, process variations, inspection, or thickness updates. These changes can include the implementation of risk mitigation strategies or maintenance based on your inspection plan.Export is also useful for providing a quick solution to bulk edit current analyses in the Created state and their related components. After exporting the records which need to be modified, you can update the records in the resulting excel file. After updating, you can re-import using the RBI Data loader process.

What to Export
The data displayed in the RBI Analysis Export workspace is based on the catalog query \\Public\Meridium\Modules\Risk Based Inspection\Queries\Data Export Analyses - 581. By default, this query returns the analyses in the Created state that are linked to RBI Components on Assets, which fall within the selected level of the asset hierarchy. This query has the following parameters:Asset: The query returns the analyses of the assets that are available after the selected value in the asset hierarchy. By default, this parameter displays the current asset hierarchy context of the RBI Overview page when navigating to the RBI Analysis Export workspace. Analysis State: The query returns analyses for only those assets which are in the selected state, Created or Active. The default value of this parameter is Created. 
The export tool takes the Component Entity Key, Asset Entity Key, and Analysis Entity Key from the selected query results to determine what data to export. The following families are considered on each exported worksheet:Asset: Equipment and Functional locationRBI Component:Criticality RBI Component – Cylindrical ShellCriticality RBI Component – Exchanger BundleCriticality RBI Component – Exchanger HeaderCriticality RBI Component – Exchanger TubeCriticality RBI Component – PipingCriticality RBI Component – Tank BottomRBI_581_Analysis: RBI 581 Risk AnalysisRBI_581_Consequence: RBI 581 Consequence EvaluationDME_Lining: 581-Internal Component Lining Damage Degradation Mechanisms in the RBI 581 Thinning and Lining EvaluationDME_AST: 581-Atmospheric Tank Bottom Corrosion Degradation Mechanisms in the RBI 581 Thinning and Lining Evaluation family:581-High Temperature Oxidation581-Cooling Water Corrosion581-High Temperature H2/H2S Corrosion581-Amine Corrosion581-Hydrofluoric Acid Corrosion581-Sulfuric Acid Corrosion581-Hydrochloric Acid Corrosion581-Acid Sour Water Corrosion581-High Temperature Sulfidic and Naphthenic Acid581-Alkaline Sour Water Corrosion581-Soil Side Corrosion581-Thinning DamageDME_Thinning: The following Degradation Mechanisms are available in the RBI 581 Thinning and Lining Evaluation family:DME_ExternalDamage: RBI 581 External Damage EvaluationDME_ExternalCracking: RBI 581 External Cracking Damage EvaluationDME_Cracking: RBI 581 Cracking Damage EvaluationDME_HTHA: RBI 581 HTHA Fracture Damage EvaluationDME_BrittleFracture: RBI 581 Brittle Fracture Damage Evaluation
RBI Analysis Export Data
The RBI Analysis Export allows you to bulk review the analyses and related data, and subsequently import it to GE Digital APM. You can export the data in the RBI 581 Data Loader format to enable importing and updating data. 
To match the RBI 581 Data Loader format, the following lookup fields are included in each sheet:Asset: Equipment ID, CMMS System, Equipment Technical NumberRBI_Component: Asset Lookup Fields, Component, Component Type, Component FamilyRBI_Criticality_Analysis: Component Lookup Fields, Analysis Unique IDConsequence_Evaluation: Analysis Lookup Fields, ConsequenceAll DME Sheets: Analysis Lookup Fields, Damage MechanismDegradation_Mechanism: Analysis Lookup Fields, Damage Mechanism
Following the lookup fields, datasheet fields for each family associated with the template sheet are exported with the following exceptions:System Fields: You cannot edit these fields. These fields are maintained by GE Digital APMOutput Fields: These fields are calculative. You cannot set these fields. Output fields are fields, which are not copied when an analysis is duplicated. 
The default datasheet in the Family Management determines the fields to be exported for each family. If there is no datasheet marked as Default in Family Management for a family, then the fields from the first available datasheet is used.
System Fields Excluded from Export
These fields are usually disabled in the datasheet.Table 1.

RBI Analysis Export Best Practices

The RBI Analysis Export workspace displays the analyses in the Created state by default. Using the RBI 581 Data Loader template, you can review the data for the analyses and re-import them into GE Digital APM. When you re-import the data, any modifications that are made to the RBI Analyses and RBI Component data in GE Digital APM, are updated. The RBI Analysis, CE, and DME updated are looked up based on the defined lookup fields and the Analysis Unique ID (MI_ANALYSIS_ID). To export an active analysis with a state other than Created and re-import it as a new analysis in a Created state, consider the following steps:Select Active for the Analysis State query parameter to return the active analysis and export.Update the MI_ANALYSIS_ID column on the analysis, consequence evaluation and degradation mechanism evaluation sheets to a unique value before importing the file into GE Digital APM. This creates a new Analysis with ID matching the value provided in the data loader template.


Note:
Data will be exported using your login and culture settings. Important: Only users with the same unit of measure and culture settings can re-import through the Risk Based Inspection (RBI) 581 Data loader.You cannot export Custom Damage Mechanism Evaluations (DME). Only baseline DME families can be exported. RBI 581 Mechanical Fatigue Damage Evaluation records cannot be exported and are not supported through the Risk Based Inspection (RBI) 581 Dataloader.
