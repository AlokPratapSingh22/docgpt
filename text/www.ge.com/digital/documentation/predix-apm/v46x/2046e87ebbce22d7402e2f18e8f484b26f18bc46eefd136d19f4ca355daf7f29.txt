Multiple records with varying temperatures and stress values may exist for a given combination of Material Specification, Material Grade, and Design Code values. So, after a match is found on Material Specification, Material Grade, and Design Code, Thickness Monitoring (TM) evaluates Design Temperature.
If the Design Temperature in the TML is an exact match to a temperature value in a Piping Stress or PV Stress record, TM will simply use the corresponding Allowable Stress value. For example, consider a TML that contains the following values:
Material Specification = SA-216Material Grade = BDesign Code = ASME B31.3Design Temperature = 100
Now, consider a Piping Stress record that contains the following values:
Material Specification = SA-216Material Grade = BDesign Code = ASME B31.3Design Temperature = 100Allowable Stress = 20000
In this case, the values in the TML are an exact match to the values in the Piping Stress record. Therefore, TM will use the Allowable Stress value of 20000 to calculate Maximum Allowable Working Pressure and T-Min.
Thickness Monitoring uses reference tables to look up the Allowable Stress values for performing T-Min calculations and for calculating Maximum Allowable Working Pressure. You have two choices regarding how the stress reference tables will be used to determine Allowable Stress when an exact match cannot be found:
You can specify that the lowest temperature in the established range should be used.You can specify that Thickness Monitoring should use linear interpolation to determine the Allowable Stress.
By default, interpolation is disabled.
Procedure
Access the TM Admin Preferences page.In the upper-right corner of the Global Preferences workspace, select .
The boxes and check boxes in the Global Preferences workspace are enabled.  is replaced with .
In the T-Min Calculator Preferences section, select the Use Interpolation for Stress Reference Tables check box.In the upper-right corner of the workspace, select .
The setting is saved, along with any other changes you have made to the preferences in the Global Preferences workspace.
Interpolation ExamplesInterpolation is Enabled
If TM cannot find an exact match in the Piping Stress or PV Stress reference table, and the Application Settings specify that interpolation should be used, TM will calculate the interpolated Allowable Stress value using the temperature and stress values that make up a range that includes the TML Design Temperature.
For example, consider a Piping Stress reference table that contains the following two records.

Record #1Record #2Material SpecificationSA-403SA-403Material GradeWP316WP316Design CodeASME B31.3ASME B31.3Design Temperature100200Allowable Stress2000018000

Now, consider a TML that contains the following values:
Material Specification = SA-403Material Grade = WP316Design Code = ASME B31.3Design Temperature = 150
The TML Design Temperature falls within the range established by the two Piping Stress records in the table. Linear interpolation assumes that stress varies linearly as a function of temperature within the defined range. Using this assumption, the Allowable Stress at 150 degrees can be calculated using the following formula:

Sx = S1 - (T1 - Tx) / (T1 - T2) * (S1 - S2)

Where:

Sx = Allowable Stress for the TML
S1 = Allowable Stress at Lower Boundary
S2 = Allowable Stress at Upper Boundary
T1 = Temperature at Lower Boundary
Tx = Temperature defined for TML
T2 = Temperature at Upper Boundary
Given the values from our example, we calculate Sx as:

Sx = 20000 - ((100 - 150) / (100 - 200) * (20000 - 18000))

So:

Sx = 19000

This interpolated Allowable Stress value will then be used to populate the Allowable Stress field in the TML.
Note: For TM to determine Allowable Stress in this way, the Piping Stress and PV Stress reference tables must contain records that establish the range that includes the TML Design Temperature.
Interpolation is Disabled
If TM cannot find an exact match in the Piping Stress or PV Stress reference table, and the Application Settings specify that interpolation should not be used, TM will use an Allowable Stress value that corresponds to the lowest temperature value in the temperature range that includes the TML Design Temperature.
For example, consider a Piping Stress reference table that contains the following two records.

 Record #1Record #2Material SpecificationSA-403SA-403Material GradeWP316WP316Design CodeASME B31.3ASME B31.3Design Temperature100200Allowable Stress2000018000

Now, consider a TML that contains the following values:
Material Specification = SA-403Material Grade = WP316Design Code = ASME B31.3Design Temperature = 150
In this case, the Design Temperature in the TML is not an exact match to a Piping Stress record. The TML Design Temperature, however, does fall within the temperature range established by the two Piping Stress records in the table. So, in this case, TM will use the record that contains the most conservative (i.e., lowest) Allowable Stress value. Therefore, in this case, an Allowable Stress value of 18,000 will be used in the TML.
Note: For TM to determine Allowable Stress in this way, the Piping Stress and PV Stress reference tables must contain records that establish the range that includes the TML Design Temperature.
Auto Manage TasksBefore You Begin
Thickness Monitoring Tasks will be created automatically when you create Corrosion Analysis Settings for an asset or TML Group, or a record that stores equipment or component data for a Corrosion Analysis. GE Digital APM provides an option that allows Thickness Monitoring Tasks to be updated automatically when you make changes to a Thickness Measurement Location (TML) record.
The Auto Manage Tasks setting is disabled by default.
Note: TM will create and update Thickness Monitoring Tasks automatically only if the Component ID setting is defined for family to which the TML is directly linked. If this setting is not defined, an error message will appear when TM attempts to create the Thickness Monitoring Task.
Procedure
Access the Global Preferences workspace.
In the upper-right corner of the workspace, select .
The boxes and check boxes in the Global Preferences workspace are enabled.  is replaced with .
In the Tasks Preferences section, select the Auto Manage Tasks? check box.In the upper-right corner of the workspace, select .
The setting is saved, along with any other changes you have made to the preferences in the Global Preferences workspace.
Results
When the Auto Manage Tasks setting is enabled, the following fields in Thickness Monitoring Task records will be updated when you make changes to a TML. The following list is not comprehensive.


Last Date: The value in the Last Date field is populated with the most recent measurement date that is associated with the first TML referenced in the NID TMLs field in the associated Asset Corrosion Analysis record.
For example, if the NID TMLs field contained the Entity Keys of the following TMLs in the following order, the most recent measurement date (the value in the Measurement Taken Date field in the linked Thickness Measurement records) associated with TML 03 would be used to populate the Last Date field in the Thickness Monitoring Task record:
TML 03TML 14TML 01


Desired Interval: The value in the Desired Interval field is populated with the difference, in days, between the values in the Next Date and Last Date fields in the Thickness Monitoring Task record.
For example, if the value in the Next Date field is 9/5/2017 and the value in the Last Date field is 3/6/2015, the Desired Interval field would be populated with the value 914.

Use Minimum Measurement Interval for Corrosion RatesBefore You Begin
This option enables you to determine which Thickness Measurements are used for calculating (either Short Term or Long Term Corrosion Rates) based on a defined interval provided. Once enabled, you can define either a global minimum interval for measurements or you may also provide site-specific minimum intervals.
The Use Minimum Measurement Interval for Corrosion Rates setting is disabled by default.
About This TaskProcedure
Access the Global Preferences workspace.
In the upper-right corner of the workspace, select .
The options in the Global Preferences workspace are enabled.  is replaced with .
In the Custom Corrosion Rate Options section, select the Use Minimum Measurement Interval for Corrosion Rates option.The Measurement Interval grid appears with an initial row for Global (all) sites. By default, the Measurement Interval value is set to 12 Months.In the Measurement Interval column, as required, define the interval for all the sites.If settings for a specific site are needed, select . A new row is added with a default interval of 12 Months and an empty Sites list.In the Measurement Interval column, as required, enter the interval values, and then select the required site(s) in the Sites list.In the upper-right corner of the workspace, select .The setting is saved along with any other changes you have made to the preferences in the Global Preferences workspace.Results
When this setting is enabled, and the TML Corrosion Analyses are calculated, if the Short Term and Long Term options are enabled in the TMLâs Corrosion Analysis Settings, the minimum measurement intervals provided are used to determine the corrosion rate calculations. 
For example, if the Use Minimum Measurement Interval for Corrosion Rates option is enabled and the default 12-month interval is saved for all the sites, consider the following two scenarios:
Short Term
The following measurements are captured on a TML:
1.24 IN â 4/15/20081.22 IN â 10/26/20151.18 IN â 2/18/20171.15 IN â 10/15/2017
When the Short Term corrosion rate is calculated for this TML, the calculation identifies the Last Measurement as the one on 10/15/2017 and the Near Measurement as the one on 2/18/2017. However, when the setting is enabled and the interval between the two measurements is not at least 12 months, the calculation moves to the next closest measurement for evaluation. The next measurement occurred is on 10/26/2015 and is valid for the measurement interval criteria. This measurement is then used as the Near Measurement when calculating the Short Term Corrosion Rate value. If the calculation needs to skip a measurement, the Short Term Based on Minimum Measurement Interval field on the TML Corrosion Analysis is set to true.
Note: The calculation continues to move back in the history of measurements looking for the valid measurement interval criteria. If valid interval is not found, the Short Term Corrosion Rate value is set to null and the Short Term Based on Minimum Measurement Interval field on the TML Corrosion Analysis is set to true.
Long Term
The following measurements are captured on a TML:
1.18 IN â 2/18/20171.15 IN â 10/15/2017
When the Long Term corrosion rate is calculated for this TML, the calculation identifies the Last Measurement as the one on 10/15/2017 and the Base Measurement as the one on 2/18/2017. However, when the setting is enabled and the interval between the two measurements is not at least 12 months, the calculation determines there is no valid Long Term Corrosion Rate, and the value is set to null. Also, the Long Term Based on Minimum Measurement Interval field on the TML Corrosion Analysis is set to true.
Note: In this scenario, the Short Term corrosion rate is also set to null as the measurement interval criteria is not valid. Therefore, the Minimum Corrosion Rate as defined in the Corrosion Analysis Settings of the TML is used as the Controlling Corrosion Rate for the TML.
What To Do NextDefine Readings PreferencesProcedure
Access the Global Preferences workspace.
Select .The boxes and check boxes in the Global Preferences workspace are enabled.  is replaced with .In the Readings Preferences section, in the Reading Tolerance box, enter the value that defines the range within which readings must fall in order to pass evaluation.
In the Readings Calculation Method box, select the value that indicates how you want Thickness Measurement values to be calculated based on the values in the Readings field. You can choose Average, Minimum, Maximum, or Custom.Note: For more information on how the Readings Tolerance value is used in calculation, refer to the Reading Tolerance topic.If you select Custom, perform the following steps:Next to the Custom Rule for Readings Calculation box, select .The Select a Project and Method from the Catalog window appears.In the pane containing the project folders, navigate to and select the Rules Library folder that contains the project that you want to use for the reading calculation rule.A list of projects that exist in the selected folder appears.In the pane containing the projects, select the project that contains the method that you want to use for the readings calculation rule.A list of valid methods within the project appears.Select the method.Select Done.The Select a Project and Method from the Catalog window closes.Select .The settings in the Global Preferences workspace are updated.Configure Nominal T-Min LookupBefore You Begin
Nominal T-Min is a value that represents the minimum thickness of a pipe based upon accepted industry standards. The Nominal T-Min value takes into account various design specifications and determines the minimum thickness associated with that criteria. The Nominal T-Min value is retrieved using values from Thickness Measurement Location records and records in the Piping Nominal T-Min reference table. Using the Nominal T-Min Preferences section, you can configure which fields you want to use for retrieving the Nominal T-Min value for Thickness Measurement Location records that are linked to Equipment or TML Group records that represent pipes, or records that store equipment or component data for pipes.
In the Nominal T-Min Preferences section, under the Fields for Nominal T-Min Lookup heading is a list of all these fields that exist in the Piping Nominal T-Min family.
Each field in the Piping Nominal T-Min family corresponds to a field in the Thickness Measurement Location family. By selecting a field in the Fields for Nominal T-Min Lookup list, you are indicating that you want to use that field for looking up Nominal T-Min values. This means that values in the associated fields in Thickness Measurement Location records will be compared to values in the Piping Nominal T-Min reference table and that a Nominal T-Min value will be returned only if a match is found. Any field that is not selected in the Fields for Nominal T-Min Lookup list will not be used for looking up the Nominal T-Min value. In other words, values in those fields of Thickness Measurement Location records are not required to match values in corresponding field in the Piping Nominal T-Min reference table.
Note: If no fields are selected in the Fields for Nominal T-Min Lookup list, the Nominal T-Min Lookup feature will be disabled. In other words, a Nominal T-Min value will never be retrieved automatically for any Thickness Measurement Location record.
