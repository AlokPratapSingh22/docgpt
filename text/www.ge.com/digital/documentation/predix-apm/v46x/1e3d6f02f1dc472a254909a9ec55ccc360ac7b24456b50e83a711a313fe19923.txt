SmartSignal ChartsAbout SmartSignal ChartsSmartSignal charts are time series charts with data plotted measuring value against time.Up to 60 SmartSignal charts can exist on a single card.You can plot up to 4000 data points on a SmartSignal Chart.SmartSignal charts are plotted based on SmartSignal tags, which fetch data from the SmartSignal data source.From the View Selector, you can access public or private templates, or a Time Series Analysis view.If you change the date range in the configuration, the data is fetched for the selected date range from the SmartSignal data source and plotted in an analysis view. The x-axis of the chart aligns with the date range and scales from the start date to the end date specified by the user.If you update or save a new template, the Context Ribbon appears, where you can change the template name, design the template as public or private, and determine if the template is for an instance or a class.The default date range for a SmartSignal Alert has a start date seven days before the event date and an end date seven days after the event date. You can also choose specific start and end dates if you prefer, but if the current date is earlier than the default end date (seven days after the event), the end date defaults to the current date.The default date range for a Time Series Analysis View has a start date of 15 days before the current date.In the workspace, select  to access Permissions. Selecting this option gives you the ability to control Visibility, Privileges, and Ownership of specific charts or groups of charts.In the workspace, select  to access the menu to execute the following actions:Display Tags as Tag AliasShow Template InformationShow SmartSignal Marker VisibilityEnable Point Mode for SmartSignal CardsAdd Card, Connect GapsUse Chart LimitsSave as New TemplateSet as Default TemplateUpdate TemplateDelete TemplateIn the workspace, select  to access the menu to execute the following actions:Edit Card NameAdd CardsDelete CardExport DataExport All Charts on This Card As Images

About SmartSignal Cycle Watch VisualizationYou can use the SmartSignal Cycle Watch visualization to view the event frames generated by the SmartSignal analytics that are deployed on an asset. This enables you to compare the events over time and identify the anomalies of the assets.SmartSignal analytics provides you the ability to detect event frames that indicate the operating mode of an asset. The SmartSignal Cycle Watch visualization enables you to view the analytics tags on the asset. You can use the visualization to view the analytics tags within the scope of the events that have been selected for you to view the variance in the output of the tags across multiple instances of the events.You can view the data associated with the event frames in the Event Frame Analysis mode. Based on the analytics that have been deployed on the asset, you can select the asset for which you want to view the event frames. You can then select the events on the asset for which you want to view the data.Additionally, the SmartSignal Cycle Watch visualization allows you to:Save the Event Frame Analysis templates for later use.Associate the Event Frame Analysis templates with alert templates and then use them to triage alerts.Access a Residual ChartYou can display residual charts for specific plotted charts on a SmartSignal card.About This Task
When you plot a model or a set of tags, some of the tags may contain residual data. 
If the Residual toggle is enabled in My Preferences>SmartSignal Chart and Marker Settings>Time Series, you will be able to see residual charts if the residual data exists on the plotted charts.
The residual chart, if present (based on fetched data or user preference selection), also aligns with the date range specified. If there is no data present, the chart does not scale based on the date range.
 The residual charts are viewed through the following interactions:

In ad hoc view, create a SmartSignal card and plot the SmartSignal tags. The residual charts are plotted if residual data is available and you have not disabled the residual charts.When navigating from alert to analysis for SmartSignal alerts, the residual charts are plotted if residual data is available and you have not disabled the residual charts.

ProcedureNavigate to an analysis view using one of the following methods:
