System ReliabilityAbout Site Filtering in System Reliability Analysis
In System Reliability Analysis, the site is assigned based on the user's selection in the Site control, and all data added or imported to the System Reliability Analysis must match the analysis's site assignment.

Tip: For more information, refer to the Site Filtering section of the documentation.

In System Reliability Analysis, Rules, users will see only data that is assigned to their site(s) or that is global data.

Consider an organization that has three sites, Site X, Site Y, and Site Z. The following System Reliability Analysis records exist:
System Reliability Analysis A: Assigned to Site XSystem Reliability Analysis B: Assigned to Site YSystem Reliability Analysis C: Assigned to Site ZSystem Reliability Analysis D: No site assigned (global record)
 Scenario 1: User assigned to only Site X 
This user will see System Reliability Analyses A and D.
 Scenario 2: User assigned to both Site X and Site Y 
This user will see System Reliability Analyses A, B, and D.
 Scenario 3: Super User 
This user will see System Reliability Analyses A, B, C, and D.
Important: If a multi-site user, or a Super User, links child records from multiple sites to a parent record designated as Global, another user who does not have access to all sites may only see a portion of the data associated with that record.
System Reliability Data Model
The following diagram shows how the families used in System Reliability Analysis are related to one another.



Note: In the diagram, boxes represent entity families and arrows represent relationship families that are configured in the baseline database. You can determine the direction of the each relationship definition from the direction of the arrow head: the box from which the arrow originates is the predecessor, and the box to which the arrow head points is the successor.
In the above image:

Black arrows and boxes represent entity families, relationship families, and associated relationship definitions that are configured in the baseline database and do not require customization for the baseline functionality to work.
Red arrows and boxes represent entity families, relationship families, and associated relationship definitions that may require customization.The System Action box represents one of four System Action subfamilies in which records can exist: System Condition Monitor, System Inspection, System Preventive Maintenance, or System Special Action. The specific family that is used will depend upon the type of Action that is created for a given Asset or Switch element.The Distribution box represents one of four Distribution subfamilies in which records can exist: Normal, Weibull, Exponential, Lognormal, Triangular, Gumbel, or Generalized Extreme Value record. The specific family that is used will depend upon the distribution type selected for the associated Risk.
Throughout this documentation, we use the term System Reliability Analysis to mean the combination of the root System Analysis record and all records that are linked to it. 
About Results of a System Reliability AnalysisWhen you run a Monte Carlo simulation, the GE Digital APM system analyzes statistics about cost, performance, and reliability from the iterations of the analysis to calculate the simulation results. The simulation results display average values as well as the specific values that were used to calculate the averages.What Can You Learn from a System Reliability Analysis? 
By reviewing the results of a System Reliability Analysis, you will be able to answer questions such as:

Which Scenario has the lowest overall cost associated with it?

Which Scenario is the least reliable?

Which Scenario has the highest failure rate?

Which Actions were successful in mitigating risk and reducing cost?

How many times were Resources used?

How much did the Resources cost?

For how long were the Resources used?

How many times was an Action required?

After reviewing the results of a System Reliability Analysis, you can identify which Scenario consistently provides the best reliability and produces the least amount of downtime and cost. Based upon the results, you might decide to complete any of the following steps:
Refine the Scenarios by modifying the analysis parameters or components within the analysis or create new components to further analyze reliability and costs.Create Recommendations to implement changes to the current physical system to align it with the most desirable Scenario.

 System Action record: Action Cost.
 System Resource record: Fixed Cost, Variable Cost, and Variable Cost Units.
 System Resource Usage record: Duration, Duration Units, and Quantity.
 Lost Production Cost: The average lost production cost across all iterations. Lost production cost includes the cost of lost production for any element when it is stopped or unable to run, according to the value in the Lost Product Cost field of the record that represents that element. Planned Correction Cost: The average planned correction cost across all the iterations. Planned correction cost includes the cost to repair an element that is identified as having a potential failure by an inspection or condition monitoring Action and any Resources used.

Histogram plot


Trend plot

About Histogram Plot
The Histogram Plot provides a visual representation of the frequency distribution of the result that you selected in the grid in the Elements section. 
Note: Interaction with graphs is not available on touch-screen devices.
Details
The Histogram Plot shows the distribution of the actual values from all iterations that were used to calculate the average value. The distribution of the actual values spreads across a series of data ranges, which are called bins and are represented by columns on the Histogram Plot. When an actual value from an iteration falls into a bin, it is included in the associated column. The higher the column is, the more values have fallen into the bin.



Note: The number of columns that appear in the Histogram Plot is determined by the value in the Histogram Bins field in the root System analysis.
Additional values are represented by the following lines in the Histogram Plot:
 Optimistic Value: Leftmost gray vertical line in the Histogram Plot. This line represents the lower level of the confidence interval. Average Value: Red line in the Histogram Plot. This line represents the mean value, which is the mean value of the values from the iterations of the Scenario.
 Realistic Value: Blue line in the Histogram Plot. This line represents the median value, which is the median value of the values from the iterations of the Scenario.
Note: If the median value falls in between two values, then the larger value will be used as the Realistic value.
 Pessimistic Value: Rightmost gray vertical line in the Histogram Plot. This line represents the upper level of the confidence interval.
About Trend Plot
The Trend Plot provides the average value for each analysis time interval, as defined by the value in the Time Analysis Type field in the root System Analysis record, of the result that you selected in the grid. 
If the Time Analysis Type field is set to:
Yearly, the Cost Trend Plot will display the Cost Trend for each year in the simulation period.Monthly, the Cost Trend Plot will display the Cost Trend for each month in the simulation period.



Note: Interaction with graphs is not available on touch-screen devices.
About Impact Plot
The Impact Plot provides visual representation of the average values that are combined to make up the average value of the result that you selected in the grid.
The Impact Plot displays how the average failure value is calculated as a total of the individual Risk failure averages.



Note:
The Impact Plot is not available for the Actions and Resources tab.
 Interaction with graphs is not available on touch-screen devices.

About Interpreting Simulation Results That Include Source and Additional RisksThe results for a simulation will appear differently depending on whether or not the simulation includes source and additional Risks. It is important that you understand how to interpret simulation results that include source and additional Risks. This documentation assumes that you are familiar with System Risk records and their role in a System Reliability Analysis. When you set up a simulation to include source and additional Risks, you should consider the following information:If an unplanned correction causes a source Risk and any additional Risks to be reset, in the simulation results, the Failure associated with the unplanned correction of the source Risk will be attributed only to the source Risk.If a planned correction of a source Risk results in additional Risks being reset, in the simulation results, the following values will be attributed to each individual Risk:Planned Correction CostPlanned Resource UsagesDowntime
Downtime for each Risk will be calculated based on the planned correction duration for that Risk.
If an unplanned correction of a source Risk results in additional Risks being reset, in the simulation results, the following values will be attributed to each individual Risk:Fixed Unplanned Correction CostVariable Unplanned Correction CostUnplanned Resource UsagessDowntime
Variable unplanned correction cost and downtime for each Risk will be calculated based on the TTR distribution for that Risk.
If planned or unplanned correction of a source Risk results in additional Risks being reset, in the simulation results, the Equipment or Functional Location record to which the System Risk records are linked will be populated with the largest downtime value of all the Risks (i.e. source and additional). For example, suppose that the following Risks are defined for a Water Pump:A Bearing failure Risk that is a source Risk and whose downtime value is 1 day.A Seal failure Risk that is an additional Risk and whose downtime value is 2 days.
In this case, when the Bearing failure Risk resets the Seal failure Risk, in the simulation results, a downtime value of 2 days will be attributed to the Water Pump.
If planned or unplanned correction has started for an additional Risk, and then, planned or unplanned correction starts for the source Risk that resets that additional Risk, the additional Risk will be reset only once, as a result of its own planned or unplanned correction. The additional Risk will not be reset two times as a result of its own planned or unplanned correction and the planned or unplanned correction of the source Risk. This will be reflected in the simulation results.About Average Total
The average total is the average of all the totals across all iterations of a simulation, which is calculated by the GE Digital APM system for each simulation. Average totals are calculated for various types of numeric values in a simulation, such as cost in the Total Cost Trend
 plot or time in the Resource Time plot.



About Simulation Period
Some results of a System Reliability Analysis are presented according to the simulation period that you have selected. The simulation period is defined by the values in the System Analysis record:
The values in the two Period boxes. The Period boxes represent the Period and Period Units fields in the System Analysis record and determine the length of the simulation.The value in the Time Analysis Type box. The Time Analysis Type box represents the Time Analysis Type field in the System Analysis record, and the value determines whether results are calculated for each year or each month of the simulation. If the Time Analysis Type is set to:Yearly, the graphs display values for each year included in the simulation period, which is defined by the values in the Period, Period Units, and Analysis Start Date fields in the System Analysis record.Monthly, the graphs display values for each month included in the simulation period, which is determined by the values in the Period, Period Units, and Analysis Start Date fields in the System Analysis record.

About Show Total Check Box
The Show Total check box is a feature that is available on the following System Reliability Analysis results plots:

Total Cost
 plot

Annual Action Cost plot

Resource Cost plot

In these graphs, each column represents a separate Scenario. The Show Total check box determines how the columns are displayed, as described in the following list:
When the Show Total check box is cleared, the plots display one column that is divided into sections representing the individual cost types or resources within that Scenario. In addition, the legend displays labels for the individual categories that are represented in each column.When the Show Total check box is selected, the plots display one column that is not divided into sections but instead displays the total cost associated with all categories in that Scenario. In addition, the legend displays the label Total.
The following image shows the Total Cost plot for our System Reliability Analysis Example when the Show Total check box is selected.



The following image, on the other hand, shows the Total Cost plot for our System Reliability Analysis Example when the Show Total check box is cleared.
