Risk Based Inspection 580Deploy RBI for the First TimeBefore You Begin

The following table outlines the steps that you must complete to deploy and configure this module for the first time. 
                
These tasks may be completed by multiple people in your organization. GE Digital recommends, however, that the tasks be completed in the order in which they are listed.

Results
StepTaskNotes
1
Assign Security Users to one or more of the Security Roles used in RBI.
This step is required.

2

Assign the following types of RBI users to at least one TM Security Group: 
Users who are responsible for completing the steps necessary to use TM Analysis values to calculate RBI 580 corrosion rates. Users who should be able to navigate to TM via RBI 580. 
This step is required only if you are using the integration between the RBI and Thickness Monitoring modules.
3

Modify the MI_DEGRADATION_MECHANISM_TYPES System Code Table.
This step is required only if you want to create your own Potential Degradation Mechanisms records.
4
Select the Recommendation Creation Enabled check box in the 
Global Preferences workspace.

This step is required only if you do not want to create Recommendations in RBI, but want to use the Asset Strategy Management (ASM) module to recommend actions and manage mitigated risk. This check box is selected by default.

5
Select the Enable Recommendations to be Generated at Created State check box in the 
Global Preferences workspace.
This step is required only if you want to create RBI Recommendation records while RBI Analysis records are in the Created state. This check box is cleared by default. 
6
Select the Allow Override of Calculated Unmitigated Risk Values check box in the 
Global Preferences workspace.
This step is required only if you want to override the calculated values of unmitigated risk because you use a custom calculator. This check box is cleared by default. 
7
Select the Consider Half-Life when Determining Inspection Task Interval check box in the 
Global Preferences workspace.

This step is required only if you want additional values such as half-life to determine the inspection task interval. This check box is cleared by default. 

8
Select the Is a Unit? check box in Functional Location records that represent units in your facility.
This step is required to mark Functional Location records as Process Units.

9
Using the Belongs to a Unit relationship, link Equipment records to Functional Location records representing units to which that equipment belongs (i.e., the Is a Unit? check box is selected).This step is optional.
10
Configure the GE Digital APM system to generate RBI Recommendation records automatically.This step is optional.
11

Create Potential Degradation Mechanisms records.
This step is required only if you want to use additional Potential Degradation Mechanisms records that are not provided in the baseline GE Digital APM database.
12

Assign a ranking to all Qualitative Potential Degradation Mechanisms records.
This step is required only if you want the Probability Category field in certain Criticality Degradation Mech Evaluation records to be populated automatically based on this ranking.
13
Add existing RBI Component Types to the MI RBI COMPONENT TYPES system code table.This step is required only if you want to use additional RBI Component type records that are not provided in the baseline GE Digital APM database.
Upgrade RBIBefore You Begin

The following tables outline the steps that you must complete to upgrade this module to the latest version of GE Digital APM
                    .
                
These tasks may be completed by multiple people in your organization. We recommend, however, that the tasks be completed in the order in which they are listed.

After you upgrade: 
All RBI Assets with Active Analyses will have a related Inspection Plan record created.All RBI recommendations for an RBI Asset will be related to Inspection Plan record of the RBI Asset.The state caption for RBI Recommendation family with State ID MI_ACCEPTED will be updated to “Approved”.The Recommendation Methodology field on RBI Recommendation will be updated to RBI 580 where previously the field had the value of "Criticality Calculator”.All security users who belong to the 'MI RBI Analyst' security group will belong to the MI Inspection Plan Approver security role.The MI Inspection Plan Approver security role will have the MI ASM Analyst security group assigned.Piping Stress updatedIn some of the Piping Stress records for B31.3, WPB was misspelled as WFB. These records are now updated based on ASME standards.In some of the Piping Stress records for B31.3 and B31.1 for the year 2014, where the Material Specification field contained the value B366 and B622, the Material Grade had the value NS instead of N/A. These records are now updated based on ASME standards.RBI 580 Representative Fluid contents have been updated for the following fluids to match the API 581, 3rd Edition, Addendum 1 specification:C13-16 (Diesel)C17-25 (Gas Oil)C25+ (Resid)C5ChlorineCOEOH2H2O (Water)H2SHClHFMEOH (Methanol)NH3PhosgeneSteamFor information on the updated RBI 580 Representative Fluid Contents, refer to the  topic.The Data Mapping Group record that satisfies the following conditions, along with its child records, will be reverted to baseline: The value in the Source Family field is Criticality RBI Component - Exchanger Bundle.The value in the Target Family field is RBI Criticality Analysis.
In some of the PV Stress records that contain the value SA/AS 1548, SB-187, SB-308, or SB-211 in the Material Specification field, values in the Minimum Yield Strength field are updated based on ASME 2010 standards.
ProcedureUpgrade to the latest version of GE Digital APM.
